 To select a single track, click its Track header in the Track list. You can also click an empty area in the Clips view. When you select a track, \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} highlights its Track header and Clips view. Selecting a track deselects all other tracks or clips.

Selecting a track shows its properties in the Inspector window. The track properties change depending on the type of track and how many tracks you select. See \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2insp__about}{Timeline Inspector}{0} for details.

To select contiguous tracks, select the first track and then hold Shift and click the last track in the series. For example, to select three contiguous tracks, click the first track, then hold Shift and click the third track. All three tracks are selected.
