\#2D \doxylink{namespace_graphics}{Graphics} Features 2D features included with URP are the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do44e5d146d286372edf6f953cab4e3a9a}{2D Lighting}{0} graphics pipeline which allows you to create 2D Lights and 2D lighting effects; and the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_22d-pixelperfect}{2D Pixel Perfect Camera}{0} for implementing the pixelated visual style with your projects. The following are the different 2D Light Types included in the package\textquotesingle{}s {\bfseries{Light 2D}} component\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{LightTypes.md\#freeform}{\texttt{ Freeform}}
\item \href{LightTypes.md\#sprite}{\texttt{ Sprite}}
\item \href{LightTypes.md\#spot}{\texttt{ Spot}} ({\bfseries{Note\+:}} The {\bfseries{Point}} Light Type has been renamed to the {\bfseries{Spot}} Light Type from URP 11 onwards.)
\item \href{LightTypes.md\#global}{\texttt{ Global}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{Important\+:}} The \href{LightTypes.md\#parametric}{\texttt{ Parametric Light Type}} is deprecated from URP 11 onwards. To convert existing Parametric lights to Freeform lights, go to {\bfseries{Edit \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Render Pipeline \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Universal Render Pipeline \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Upgrade Project/\+Scene Parametric Lights to Freeform}}



The package includes the {\bfseries{2D Renderer Data}} Asset which contains the {\bfseries{Blend Styles}} parameters, and allows you to create up to four custom Light Operations for your Project.

{\bfseries{Note\+:}} If you have the experimental 2D Renderer enabled (menu\+: {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_graphics}{Graphics} Settings}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} add the 2D Renderer Asset under {\bfseries{Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings}}), some of the options related to 3D rendering in the URP Asset don\textquotesingle{}t have any impact on your final app or game.
