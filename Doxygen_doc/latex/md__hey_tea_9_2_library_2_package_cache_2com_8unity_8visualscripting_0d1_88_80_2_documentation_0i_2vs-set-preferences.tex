For example, an {\ttfamily Audio Source} is a {\ttfamily Component}\+: it has its own specific methods and nodes, but you can interact with it as a {\ttfamily Component} with {\ttfamily Component} nodes. While you perform a search in the fuzzy finder, Visual Scripting groups the nodes inherited from {\ttfamily Component} and displays them in grey. ~\newline
Disable {\bfseries{Group Inherited Members}} to display nodes in the search results without grouping these inherited nodes.  }\\\cline{1-3}

{\bfseries{AOT Safe Mode}} &\multicolumn{2}{l|}{Enable {\bfseries{AOT Safe Mode}} to exclude nodes from search results in \href{vs-interface-overview.md\#the-fuzzy-finder}{\texttt{ the fuzzy finder}} that might cause problems for platforms that require ahead of time (AOT) compilation. For example, Visual Scripting excludes nodes that use the {\ttfamily Generic} type. ~\newline
