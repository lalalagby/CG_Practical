This sample demonstrates how to use the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} APIs to set up a rebinding UI. The main file is \href{./RebindActionUI.cs}{\texttt{ Rebind\+Action\+UI}} which, aside from serving as an example, contains a reusable {\ttfamily Mono\+Behaviour} component for composing rebinding UIs. The \href{./RebindUIPrefab.prefab}{\texttt{ Rebind\+UIPrefab}} contains a ready-\/made prefab that can be used as a simple drop-\/in setup for rebinding an individual action.

To demonstrate how to use images instead of textual display strings, take a look at \href{./GamepadIconsExample.cs}{\texttt{ Gamepad\+Icons\+Example}}.

Finally, the \href{./RebindSaveLoad.cs}{\texttt{ Rebind\+Save\+Load}} script demonstrates how to persist user rebinds in {\ttfamily Player\+Prefs} and how to restore them from there.

The icons used in the sample are taken from \href{https://opengameart.org/content/free-keyboard-and-controllers-prompts-pack}{\texttt{ Free Prompts Pack v4.\+0}} created by, and made available to public domain by Nicolae Berbece.
