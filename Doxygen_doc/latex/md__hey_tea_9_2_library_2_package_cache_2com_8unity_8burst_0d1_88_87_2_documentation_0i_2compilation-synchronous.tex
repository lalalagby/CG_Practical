 By default, when in Play mode, the \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} compiler compiles jobs asynchronously. To force synchronous compilation, set the \href{xref:Unity.Burst.BurstCompileAttribute.CompileSynchronously}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Compile\+Synchronously}}} property to {\ttfamily true}, which compiles your method on the first schedule.

If you don\textquotesingle{}t set this property, on the first call of a job, \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} compiles it asynchronously in the background, and runs a managed C\# job in the mean time. This minimizes any frame hitching and keeps the experience responsive.

However, when you set {\ttfamily Compile\+Synchronously = true}, no asynchronous compilation can happen. This means that it might take longer for \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} to compile. This pause for compilation affects the current running frame, which means that hitches can happen and it might provide an unresponsive experience for users.

In general, only use {\ttfamily Compile\+Synchronously = true} in the following situations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you have a long running job that only runs once. The performance of the compiled code might outweigh the downsides doing the compilation synchronously.
\item If you\textquotesingle{}re profiling a \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} job and want to test the code from the \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} compiler. When you do this, perform a warmup to discard any timing measurements from the first call to the job. This is because the profiling data includes the compilation time and skews the result.
\item To aid with debugging the difference between managed and \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} compiled code.
