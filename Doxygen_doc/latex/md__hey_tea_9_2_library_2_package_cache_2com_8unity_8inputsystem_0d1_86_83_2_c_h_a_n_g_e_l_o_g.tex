\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added internal {\ttfamily Input\+System\+Provider} class for the new {\ttfamily Input\+For\+UI} internal module. {\ttfamily Input\+For\+UI} allows the UIToolkit to have a single dependency for input events, regardless of using the new input system or the legacy input system.
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+custom\+Binding\+Path\+Validators} interface to allow showing warnings in the {\ttfamily Input\+Asset} Editor for specific Input\+Bindings and draw custom UI in the properties panel.
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+run\+In\+Background} to be used internally by specific platforms packages. Allows telling the input system that a specific platform runs in background. It allows fixing of \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-6744}{\texttt{ case UUM-\/6744}}.
\item Added new UIToolkit version of the {\ttfamily Input\+Actions\+Asset} editor. Currently this is incomplete (view-\/only) and the existing editor is still used by default.
\item Added {\ttfamily display\+Index} field to the Touch struct to expose the index of the display that was touched.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Binding\+Path String-\/\+Comparison to be culture and case insensitive (case ISXB-\/449).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed unclosed profiler marker in {\ttfamily Invoke\+Callbacks\+Safe\+\_\+\+Any\+Callback\+Returns\+True} which would lead to eventually broken profiler traces in some cases like using {\ttfamily Player\+Input} (case ISXB-\/393).
\item Fixed Input\+Action.\+bindings.\+count not getting correctly updated after removing bindings with Erase().
\item Fixed an issue where connecting a gamepad in the editor with certain settings will cause memory and performance to degrade (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-19480}{\texttt{ case UUM-\/19480}}).
\item Fixed issue leading to a stack overflow crash during device initialization in {\ttfamily Insert\+Control\+Bit\+Range\+Node} (case ISXB-\/405).
\item Fixed the issue where saving and loading override bindings to JSON would set unassigned overrides (that were {\ttfamily null}) to assigned overrides (as an empty string {\ttfamily "{}"{}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for reading Tracking State in \href{xref:UnityEngine.InputSystem.XR.TrackedPoseDriver}{\texttt{ Tracked\+Pose\+Driver}} to constrain whether the input pose is applied to the Transform. This should be used when the device supports valid flags for the position and rotation values, which is the case for XR poses.
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+shortcut\+Keys\+Consume\+Input}. This allows programmatic access to opt-\/in to the enhanced shortcut key behaviour (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-254}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/254}})).
\item Significantly optimized cost of {\ttfamily Read\+Value}/{\ttfamily Read\+Unprocessed\+Value\+From\+State}/{\ttfamily Write\+Value\+Into\+State} for some control types. Optimization is opt-\/in for now, please call {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings.\+Set\+Internal\+Feature\+Flag("{}\+USE\+\_\+\+OPTIMIZED\+\_\+\+CONTROLS"{}, true);} in your project to enable it. You can observe which controls are optimized by looking at new optimized column in device debugger. You will need to call a new {\ttfamily Input\+Control.\+Apply\+Parameter\+Changes()} method if the code is changing {\ttfamily Axis\+Control} fields after initial setup is done.
\item Added the ability to change the origin positioning and movement behaviour of the On\+Screen\+Stick ({\ttfamily On\+Screen\+Stick.\+cs}) via the new {\ttfamily behaviour} property. This currently supports three modes of operation, two of which are new in addition to the previous behaviour. Based on the user contribution from \href{https://github.com/eblabs}{\texttt{ eblabs}} in \href{https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/pull/658}{\texttt{ \#658}}.
\item Significantly optimized cost of {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Read\+Value} and {\ttfamily Input\+Control.\+Read\+Value} calls by introducing caching behaviour to input controls. Input controls now keep track of whether their underlying state has been changed and only read the value from the underlying state and apply processors when absolutely necessary. Optimization is opt-\/in for now, please call {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings.\+Set\+Internal\+Feature\+Flag("{}\+USE\+\_\+\+READ\+\_\+\+VALUE\+\_\+\+CACHING"{}, true);} in your project to enable it. If there are issues try enabling {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings.\+Set\+Internal\+Feature\+Flag("{}\+PARANOID\+\_\+\+READ\+\_\+\+VALUE\+\_\+\+CACHING\+\_\+\+CHECKS"{}, true);} and check in the console if there are any errors regarding caching.
\item Added a note in the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_supported_devices}{supported devices page}{0} about Dual\+Sense support for Android devices.
\item Exposed {\ttfamily display\+Index} property for {\ttfamily Pointer}, {\ttfamily Touchscreen}, {\ttfamily Touch\+Control}, {\ttfamily Touch\+State}, {\ttfamily Mouse}, {\ttfamily Mouse\+State} which enables look up of the logical screen associated with a pointer event via (display documentation)\mbox{[}\href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Display.html}{\texttt{ https\+://docs.\+unity3d.\+com/\+Script\+Reference/\+Display.\+html}}\mbox{]}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed composite bindings incorrectly getting a control scheme assigned when pasting into input asset editor with a control scheme selected.
\item Fixed an issue on PS5 where device disconnected events that happen while the app is in the background are missed causing orphaned devices to hang around forever and exceptions when the same device is added again (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/UUM-6744}{\texttt{ case UUM-\/7842}}).
\item Fixed Switch Pro, Dual\+Shock 4, Dual\+Sense gamepads becoming current on PC/mac\+OS when no controls are changing (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-223}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/223}})).
\item Fixed an issue that made On\+Screen\+Stick unusable when used in conjunction with Player\+Input in Auto-\/\+Switch devices mode, or with any code that changes user/device pairing on unsued device activity being detected (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-48}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/48}}).
\item Fixed issue where input events were being suppressed during interactive action rebinding even when when their controls were excluded (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-position-and-mouse-click-input-not-recognized-when-rebinding-is-active}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/367}}).
\item Removed unneeded check that could trigger a Not\+Implemented\+Exception when binding to a Usage (e.\+g. Submit) (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-373}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/373}}).
\item Display a warning instead of throwing a Not\+Implemented\+Exception when loading binding overrides from json when some of the entries have become outdated (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-375}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/375}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Argument\+Null\+Exception} when opening the Prefab Overrides window and selecting a component with an {\ttfamily Input\+Action}.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily \{file\+ID\+: 0\}} getting appended to {\ttfamily Project\+Settings.\+asset} file when building a project (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-296}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/296}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Type of instance in array does not match expected type} assertion when using Player\+Input in combination with Control Schemes and Interactions (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-282}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/282}}).
\item The {\ttfamily Input\+Actions consume their inputs} behaviour for shortcut support introduced in v1.\+4 is opt-\/in now and can be enabled via the project settings (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-254}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/254}})).
\item Fixed Memory alignment issue with deserialized Input\+Event\+Traces that could cause infinite loops when playing back replays (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-317}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/317}}).

\item Improved performance of HID descriptor parsing by moving json parsing to a simple custom predicitve parser instead of relying on \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity}\textquotesingle{}s json parsing. This should improve domain reload times when there are many HID devices connected to a machine.

\item Fix UI sometimes ignoring the first mouse click event after losing and regaining focus (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-127}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/127}}.
\item Fixed issue when using Multiplayer\+Event\+Systems where the visual state of UI controls would change due to constant toggling of Canvas\+Group.\+interactable on and off (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-112}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/112}}).
\item Fixed minor issue when renaming input actions where unique renaming would incorrectly consider the input action being renamed as a different action and not allow renaming of \textquotesingle{}A\textquotesingle{} to \textquotesingle{}a\textquotesingle{} without appending a unique integer for example (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-25}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/25}}).
\item Fixed an issue where the Input Action asset icon would not be visible during asset creation (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/ISXB-6}{\texttt{ case ISXB-\/6}}).
\item Fixed Dual\+Sense low frequency motor speed being always set to min value.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This also applies to {\ttfamily Press\+Interaction} when set to {\ttfamily Press} behavior.
\item In effect, it means that a button will be in {\ttfamily started} or {\ttfamily performed} phase for as long as its value is not 0 and will only go to {\ttfamily canceled} once dropping to 0.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Processors are now always applied when reading action values through {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} or {\ttfamily Callback\+Context.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}. Previously, if no bound control was actuated, Read\+Value calls would return the default value for the action type but not run the value through the processors.(\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1293728/}{\texttt{ case 1293728}}).
\item Made the following internal types public. These types can be useful when deconstructing raw events captured via {\ttfamily Input\+Event\+Trace}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Input\+System.\+Android.\+Low\+Level.\+Android\+Axis}
\item {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Input\+System.\+Android.\+Low\+Level.\+Android\+Game\+Controller\+State}
\item {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Input\+System.\+Android.\+Low\+Level.\+Android\+Key\+Code}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Adding or removing a device no longer leads to affected actions being temporarily disabled (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputactionreferences-reading-resets-when-inputactionmap-has-an-action-for-the-other-hand-and-that-hand-starts-slash-stops-tracking}{\texttt{ case 1379932}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If, for example, an action was bound to {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Gamepad\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/button\+South} and was enabled, adding a second {\ttfamily Gamepad} would lead to the action being temporarily disabled, then updated, and finally re-\/enabled.
\item This was especially noticeable if the action was currently in progress as it would get cancelled and then subsequently resumed.
\item Now, an in-\/progress action will get cancelled if the device of its active control is removed. If its active control is not affected, however, the action will keep going regardless of whether controls are added or removed from its {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+controls} list.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Installing the package for the first time will now set {\ttfamily "{}\+Active Input Handling"{}} to {\ttfamily "{}\+Both"{}} rather than {\ttfamily "{}\+Input System Package"{}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means, that by default, both the old and the new input system will run side by side where supported.
\item This can be manually switched by going to {\ttfamily Edit \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Project Settings \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \doxylink{class_player}{Player} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Active Input Handling}.

\item Fixed an issue where a layout-\/override registered via {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Register\+Layout\+Override(...)} would cause the editor to malfunction or crash if the layout override had a name already used by an existing layout (case 1377685).
\item Fixed an issue where attempting to replace an existing layout-\/override by using an existing layout-\/override name didn\textquotesingle{}t work as expected and would instead aggregate overrides instead of replacing them when an override with the given name already exists.
\item Fixed Switch Pro controller not working correctly in different scenarios (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-output-garbage}{\texttt{ case 1369091}}, \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-windows-switch-pro-controller-only-works-when-connected-via-bluetooth-but-not-via-usb}{\texttt{ case 1190216}}, case 1314869).
\item Fixed Dual\+Shock 4 controller not allowing input from other devices due to noisy input from its unmapped sensors (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-from-the-keyboard-is-not-working-when-the-dualshock-4-controller-is-connected}{\texttt{ case 1365891}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+on\+Any\+Button\+Press} so that it doesn\textquotesingle{}t throw exceptions when trying to process non state or delta events (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1376034/}{\texttt{ case 1376034}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Path.\+Matches} incorrectly reporting matches when only a prefix was matching.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This would, for example, cause {\ttfamily Keyboard.\+e\+Key} to be matched by {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Keyboard\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/escape}.
\item Fix contributed by \href{https://github.com/steinbitglis}{\texttt{ Fredrik Ludvigsen}} in \href{https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/pull/1485}{\texttt{ \#1485}}.

\item Fixed no devices being available in {\ttfamily Start} and {\ttfamily Awake} methods if, in the player, any {\ttfamily Input\+System} API was accessed during the {\ttfamily Subsystem\+Registration} phase (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-does-not-initialize-properly-in-a-build-when-accessed-early}{\texttt{ case 1392358}}).
\item Fixed dropdown for "{}\+Supported Devices"{} in settings not showing all device layouts.
\item Fixed "{}\+STAT event with state format TOUC cannot be used with device \textquotesingle{}\+Touchscreen\+:/\+Touchscreen\textquotesingle{}"{} when more than max supported amount of fingers, currently 10, are present on the screen at a same time (case 1395648).
\item Fixed mouse events not being timesliced when input system is switched to process input in fixed updates (case 1386738).
\item Fixed missing tooltips in Player\+Input\+Manager\+Editor for the \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Limit and Fixed Splitscreen sizes labels (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-input-manager-pops-up-placeholder-text-when-hovering-over-it}{\texttt{ case 1396945}}).
\item Fixed Dual\+Shock 4 controllers not working in some scenarios by adding support for extended mode HID reports (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-dualshock4-controller-returns-random-input-values-when-connected-via-bluetooth-while-steam-is-running}{\texttt{ case 1281633}}, case 1409867).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Background\+Behavior.\+Ignore\+Focus} having no effect when {\ttfamily Application.\+run\+In\+Background} was false (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-head-tracking-lost-when-lost-focus-with-action-based-trackedposedriver-on-android}{\texttt{ case 1400456}}).

\item Fixed accessing {\ttfamily Input\+Action}s directly during {\ttfamily Runtime\+Initialize\+On\+Load} not initializing the input system as a whole and leading to exceptions (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-nullreferenceexception-error-is-thrown-when-using-input-actions-in-builds}{\texttt{ case 1378614}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Get\+Timeout\+Completion\+Percentage} jumping to 100\% completion early (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/gettimeoutcompletionpercentage-returns-1-after-0-dot-1s-when-hold-action-was-started-even-though-it-is-not-performed-yet}{\texttt{ case 1377009}}).
\item Fixed d-\/pad inputs sometimes being ignored on actions that were binding to multiple controls (\href{https://unity.slack.com/archives/G01RVV1SPU4/p1642501574002300}{\texttt{ case 1389858}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Index\+Out\+Of\+Range\+Exception} when having multiple interactions on an action and/or binding in an action map other than the first of an asset (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/map-index-on-trigger-and-indexoutofrangeexception-are-thrown-when-using-interaction-on-both-binding-and-its-parent-action}{\texttt{ case 1392559}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix contributed by \href{https://github.com/russellquinn}{\texttt{ Russell Quinn}} in \href{https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/pull/1483}{\texttt{ \#1483}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Axis\+Composite} not respecting processors applied to {\ttfamily positive} and {\ttfamily negative} bindings (case 1398942).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This was a regression introduced in \doxylink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_axiscomposite-min-max-value-fix}{1.0.0-\/pre.6}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed calling {\ttfamily action.\+Add\+Composite\+Binding(...).With(...)} while action is enabled not correctly updating controls for part bindings of the composite.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Two\+Modifiers\+Composite} inadvertently not allowing controls other than {\ttfamily Button\+Control}s being bound to its {\ttfamily binding} part.
\item Added support for keyboard shortcuts and mutually exclusive use of modifiers.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In short, this means that a "{}\+Shift+\+B"{} binding can now prevent a "{}\+B"{} binding from triggering.
\item {\ttfamily One\+Modifier\+Composite}, {\ttfamily Two\+Modifiers\+Composite}, as well as the legacy {\ttfamily Button\+With\+One\+Modifier\+Composite} and {\ttfamily Button\+With\+Two\+Modifiers\+Composite} now require their modifiers to be pressed {\bfseries{before}} (or at least simultaneously with) pressing the target button.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This check is performed only if the target is a button. For a binding such as {\ttfamily "{}\+CTRL+\+Mouse\+Delta"{}} the check is bypassed. It can also be manually bypassed via the {\ttfamily override\+Modifiers\+Need\+To\+Be\+Pressed\+First}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item State change monitors on a device ({\ttfamily IInput\+State\+Change\+Monitor}) are now sorted by their {\ttfamily monitor\+Index} and will trigger in that order.
\item Actions are now automatically arranging their bindings to trigger in the order of decreasing "{}complexity"{}. This metric is derived automatically. The more complex a composite a binding is part of, the higher its complexity. So, {\ttfamily "{}\+Shift+\+B"{}} has a higher "{}complexity"{} than just {\ttfamily "{}\+B"{}}.
\item If an binding of higher complexity "{}consumes"{} a given input, all bindings waiting to consume the same input will automatically get skipped. So, if a {\ttfamily "{}\+Shift+\+B"{}} binding composite consumes a {\ttfamily "{}\+B"{}} key press, a binding to {\ttfamily "{}\+B"{}} that is waiting in line will get skipped and not see the key press.
\item If your project is broken by these changes, you can disable the new behaviors via a feature toggle in code\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.settings.SetInternalFeatureFlag(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}DISABLE\_SHORTCUT\_SUPPORT"{}},\ \textcolor{keyword}{true});}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new APIs for getting and setting parameter values on interactions, processors, and composites.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for "{}\+Hori Co HORIPAD for Nintendo Switch"{}, "{}\+HORI Pokken Tournament DX Pro Pad"{}, "{}\+HORI Wireless Switch Pad"{}, "{}\+HORI Real Arcade Pro V Hayabusa in Switch Mode"{}, "{}\+Power\+A NSW Fusion Wired Fight\+Pad"{}, "{}\+Power\+A NSW Fusion Pro Controller (\+USB only)"{}, "{}\+PDP Wired Fight Pad Pro\+: Mario"{}, "{}\+PDP Faceoff Wired Pro Controller for Nintendo Switch"{}, "{}\+PDP Faceoff Wired Pro Controller for Nintendo Switch"{}, "{}\+PDP Afterglow Wireless Switch Controller"{}, "{}\+PDP Rockcandy Wired Controller"{}.
\item Added support for Steel\+Series Nimbus+ gamepad on Mac (addition contributed by \href{https://github.com/MollyJameson}{\texttt{ Mollyjameson}}).
\item Added support for Game \doxylink{namespace_core}{Core} platforms to XR layouts, devices, and input controls. These classes were previously only enabled on platforms where {\ttfamily ENABLE\+\_\+\+VR} is defined.
\item Added a new {\ttfamily Delta\+Control} control type that is now used for delta-\/style controls such as {\ttfamily Mouse.\+delta} and {\ttfamily Mouse.\+scroll}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Like {\ttfamily Stick\+Control}, this control has individual {\ttfamily up}, {\ttfamily down}, {\ttfamily left}, and {\ttfamily right} controls (as well as {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y} that it inherits from {\ttfamily Vector2\+Control}). This means it is now possible to directly bind to individual scroll directions (such as {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Mouse\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/scroll/up}).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added the \textquotesingle{}Cursor Lock Behavior\textquotesingle{} setting to Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module to control the origin point of UI raycasts when the cursor is locked. This enables the use of Physics\+Raycaster when the cursor is locked to the center of the screen (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1395281/}{\texttt{ case 1395281}}).

\item The artificial {\ttfamily ctrl}, {\ttfamily shift}, and {\ttfamily alt} controls (which combine the left and right controls into one) on the keyboard can now be written to and no longer throw {\ttfamily Not\+Supported\+Exception} when trying to do so (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/on-screen-button-errors-on-mouse-down-slash-up-when-its-control-path-is-set-to-control-keyboard}{\texttt{ case 1340793}}).
\item All devices are now re-\/synced/reset in next update after entering play mode, this is needed to read current state of devices before any intentional input is provided (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mouse-coordinates-reported-as-00-until-the-first-move}{\texttt{ case 1231907}}).
\item Replaced {\ttfamily Unity\+Linker\+Build\+Pipeline\+Data.\+input\+Directory} with hardcoded {\ttfamily Temp} folder because {\ttfamily input\+Directory} is deprecated.
\item Deprecated {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+filter\+Noise\+On\+Current}. Now noise filtering is always enabled. Device only will become {\ttfamily .current} if any non-\/noise control have changed state.
\item A device reset (such as when focus is lost) on {\ttfamily Touchscreen} will now result in all ongoing touches getting cancelled instead of all touches being simply reset to default state.
\item Calling {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture.\+Press}, {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture.\+Set}, etc. from within a {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Unity\+Test\mbox{]}} will no longer immediately process input. Instead, input will be processed like it normally would as part of the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} player loop.

\item Fixed writing values into the half-\/axis controls of sticks (such as {\ttfamily Gamepad.\+left\+Stick.\+left}) producing incorrect values on the stick (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputtestfixture-tests-return-inverted-values-when-pressing-gamepads-left-or-down-joystick-buttons}{\texttt{ case 1336240}}).
\item Fixed setting size of event trace in input debugger always growing back to largest size set before.
\item Fixed successive clicks not getting triggered with {\ttfamily Touch\+Simulation} on when not moving the mouse in-\/between clicks (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onclick-isnt-triggered-on-the-second-click-when-the-mouse-isnt-moved-and-simulate-touch-input-from-mouse-or-pen-is-enabled}{\texttt{ case 1330014}}).

\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} showing incorrect bindings after pressing the \textquotesingle{}Fix UI Input Module\textquotesingle{} button in Player\+Input component(\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1319968/}{\texttt{ case 1319968}}).
\item Fixed an issue where UI button clicks could be ignored by {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} if modifying on-\/screen devices from Update() callbacks (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1365070}{\texttt{ case 1365070}}).
\item Fixed an issue with {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} that would cause UI to stop responding during play mode after changing a script file while Recompile and Continue mode is active, or by forcing a script recompile using {\ttfamily Request\+Script\+Compilation}(\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1324215/}{\texttt{ case 1324215}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} inspector showing all action bindings as "{}\+None"{} when assigned a runtime created actions asset (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-ui-input-module-loses-prefab-action-mapping-in-local-co-op}{\texttt{ case 1304943}}).
\item Fixed a problem with UI Toolkit buttons remaining active when multiple fingers are used on a touchscreen, using {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} with pointer\+Behavior set to {\ttfamily UIPointer\+Behavior.\+Single\+Unified\+Pointer}. UI Toolkit will now always receive the same pointer\+Id when that option is in use, regardless of the hardware component that produced the pointer event. (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/transitions-get-stuck-when-pointer-behavior-is-set-to-single-unified-pointer-and-multiple-touches-are-made}{\texttt{ case 1369081}}).
\item Fixed a problem with {\ttfamily Input\+User} where devices would be removed and not added again after layout overrides preventing certain devices, e.\+g. gamepads to not work correctly when associated with action map bindings tied to {\ttfamily Player\+Input} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1347320}{\texttt{ case 1347320}}).
\item Fixed Dual\+Sense on i\+OS not inheriting from {\ttfamily Dual\+Shock\+Gamepad} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-dualsense-detection-ios}{\texttt{ case 1378308}}).
\item Fixed a device becoming {\ttfamily .current} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Gamepad.\+current}, etc) when sending a new state event that contains no control changes (case 1377952).
\item Fixed calling {\ttfamily Is\+Pressed} on an entire device returning {\ttfamily true} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputcontrol-dot-ispressed-always-returns-true-when-using-new-input-system}{\texttt{ case 1374024}}).
\item Fixed HIDs having blackslashes in their vendor or product names leading to binding paths generated by interactive rebinding that failed to resolve to controls and thus lead to no input being received (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1335465/}{\texttt{ case 1335465}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Register\+Layout\+Override} resulting in the layout that overrides are being applied to losing the connection to its base layout (\href{https://fogbugz.unity3d.com/f/cases/1377719/}{\texttt{ case 1377719}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This fix relies on a {\ttfamily Canvas\+Group} being injected into each {\ttfamily player\+Root} and the {\ttfamily interactable} property of the group being toggled back and forth depending on which part of the UI is being updated.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture} incorrectly running input updates out of sync with the player loop (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/buttoncontrol-dot-waspressedthisframe-is-false-when-using-inputtestfixture-dot-press}{\texttt{ case 1341740}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This had effects such as {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Was\+Pressed\+This\+Frame()} returning false expectedly.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed opening a new project (or one that needs a full reimport) leading to several exceptions in the console if the most recently opened project was closed with a {\ttfamily .inputactions} editor open (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/exceptions-about-previously-open-action-map-being-thrown-when-opening-new-project}{\texttt{ case 1313185}}).
\item Fixed incorrect indentation of input actions in the inspector (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1285546/}{\texttt{ case 1285546}}).
\item Fixed an issue where serialized {\ttfamily Input\+Action} properties would have display name "{}\+Input Action"{} in the Inspector window instead of their given name. (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1367240}{\texttt{ case 1367240}}).
\item Fixed an issue where {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Enable} would not reuse memory allocated prior and thus lead to memory leaks (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-puts-a-lot-of-pressure-on-the-garbage-collector-when-enabling-and-disabling-inputactionmaps}{\texttt{ case 1367442}}).
\item Fixed interactions such as {\ttfamily Press} not getting processed correctly when having multiple of them on different bindings of the same action and receiving simultaneous input on all of them (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-input-system-stops-working-after-pressing-2-keyboard-buttons-at-the-same-time}{\texttt{ case 1364667}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If, for example, you bind the A and S key on the same action, put a {\ttfamily Press} interaction on both, and then press both keys, interactions would get missed or got stuck.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Is\+Pressed}/{\ttfamily Was\+Pressed}/{\ttfamily Was\+Released} returning incorrect results when binding multiple buttons on the same action and pressing/releasing them simultaneously.
\item Improved performance of looking up actions by name.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+controls} exhibiting bad performance when there were no controls bound to an action (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputaction-dot-controls-are-accessed-slower-when-the-gamepad-slash-controller-is-not-connected}{\texttt{ case 1347829}}).
\item Fixed interactions involving timeouts (such as {\ttfamily Hold\+Interaction}) performing erroneous delayed triggers on actions when input is composed of multiple controls (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-composites-hold-interaction-can-be-performed-when-no-keys-are-hold}{\texttt{ 1251231}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For example, if you bind {\ttfamily Shift+B} using a {\ttfamily One\+Modifier\+Composite} and put a {\ttfamily Hold\+Interaction} on the binding, then depending on the order in which the keys are pressed, you would sometimes see the action spuriously getting triggered when in fact no input was received.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed control schemes of bindings not getting updates when being pasted from one {\ttfamily .inputactions} asset into another (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-control-schemes-are-not-resolved-when-copying-bindings-between-inputactionassets}{\texttt{ case 1276106}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For example, if you copied a binding from an asset that had a "{}\+Gamepad"{} control scheme into an asset that had none, the resulting binding would be unusable.
\item All associations with control schemes that do not exist in the target asset are now removed from bindings upon pasting.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Setup\+Extensions.\+Add\+Composite\+Binding} not setting name of composite.

\item Fixed a performance issue on entering/exiting playmode where HID device capabilities JSON could be parsed multiple times for a single device(\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-package-deserializing-json-multiple-times-when-entering-slash-exiting-playmode}{\texttt{ case 1362733}}).
\item Fixed a problem where explicitly switching to the already active control scheme and device set for Player\+Input would cancel event callbacks for no reason when the control scheme switch would have no practical effect. This fix detects and skips device unpairing and re-\/pairing if the switch is detected to not be a change to scheme or devices. (case 1342297)
\item Any unhandled exception in {\ttfamily Input\+Manager.\+On\+Update} failing latter updates with {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exception\+: Already have an event buffer set! Was On\+Update() called recursively?}. Instead the system will try to handle the exception and recover into a working state.
\item Fixed an issue that broke the {\ttfamily Virtual\+Mouse\+Input} component in the editor (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/vitrualmouseinput-stickaction-doesnt-work}{\texttt{ case 1367553}}).
\item Fixed a problem where only using runtimes that are not XR supported causes a compile error. This fix adds back in {\ttfamily ENABLE\+\_\+\+VR} checks to prevent this case (case 1368300)
\item Fixed input action for Android gamepad\textquotesingle{}s right stick will be correctly invoked when only y axis is changing (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-input-system-right-analog-stick-tracking-is-erratic-when-using-a-gamepad-connected-to-an-android-device}{\texttt{ case 1308637}}).
\item Generic gamepad short display button names were incorrectly mapped on Switch ({\ttfamily A} instead of {\ttfamily B}, etc).
\item Fixed an issue where resetting an action via {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Reset()} while being in disabled state would prevent the action from being enabled again. (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1370732/}{\texttt{ case 1370732}}).
\item Fixed "{}\+Default constructor not found for type Unity\+Engine.\+Input\+System.\+i\+OS.\+Low\+Level.\+i\+OSStep\+Counter"{} any other potential exceptions due to classes, methods, fields and properties being stripped when managed stripping setting set to medium or high (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/ios-new-input-system-iosstepcounter-crash-on-launch-with-managed-stripping}{\texttt{ case 1368761}}).
\item Fixed an issue where {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exceptions} are thrown if an input for an action with multiple interactions is held while disconnecting the device(\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-errors-are-thrown-when-disconnecting-controller-while-holding-a-button-with-press-and-release-set-up-separately}{\texttt{ case 1354098}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added support for PS5 Dual\+Sense controllers on Mac and Windows.
\item Improved the user experience when creating single vs multi-\/touch touchscreen bindings in the Input Action Asset editor by making both options visible in the input action dropdown menu.

\item Added support for the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Remote app.
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item Internally, a control is now again allowed to feed into the same action through more than one binding.
\item However, externally the control will be mentioned on the action\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+controls} list only once.

\item Fixed regression introduced by \doxylink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_ui_multiple_scenes_fix}{previous change} where {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} would not disable actions correctly.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+canceled} not getting triggered reliably for {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Type.\+Pass\+Through} actions when {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Reset\+Device} was called.
\item Fixed device resets (e.\+g. happening as part of focus changes) leading to only some actions bound to these devices getting cancelled instead of all of them.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+run\+Updates\+In\+Edit\+Mode} to enable processing of non-\/editor updates without entering playmode (only available for XR).
\item Added a new "{}\+UI vs Game Input"{} sample to the package. The sample can be installed from the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Package Manager UI in the editor.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The sample demonstrates how to deal with inputs that may both lead to UI actions as well as in-\/game actions.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added method {\ttfamily Set\+Motor\+Speeds\+And\+Light\+Bar\+Color} as a workaround for setting both the light bar and motor speeds simultaneously on a Dual\+Shock 4 controller (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/dualshock4-setlightbarcolor-and-setmotorspeeds-cannot-be-called-on-the-same-frame-using-input-system}{\texttt{ case 1271119}}).
\item Added the concept of "{}soft"{} and "{}hard"{} device resets.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In general, resetting a device will reset its state to default values.
\item Individual controls can be marked as {\ttfamily dont\+Reset} to exclude them from resets. This makes the reset "{}soft"{} (default). 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ \ Perform\ a\ "{}soft"{}\ reset\ of\ the\ mouse.\ The\ mouse\ position\ will\ not\ be\ affected}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ but\ controls\ such\ as\ buttons\ will\ be\ reset.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.ResetDevice(Mouse.current);}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item A "{}hard"{} reset can be forced through the API. This also resets {\ttfamily dont\+Reset} controls. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Perform\ a\ "{}hard"{}\ reset\ of\ the\ mouse.\ The\ mouse\ position\ will\ also\ be\ reset\ to\ (0,0).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.ResetDevice(Mouse.current,\ alsoResetDontResetControls:\ true);}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Resets will lead to {\ttfamily Input\+Action}s that are enabled and in-\/progress from controls that being reset, to be canceled. This will not perform actions even if they trigger on, for example, button release.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Device.\+can\+Run\+In\+Background} can now be force-\/set through layouts. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Force\ XInputWindows\ gamepads\ to\ not\ run\ in\ the\ background.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.RegisterLayoutOverride(\textcolor{stringliteral}{@"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ \{}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}"{}name"{}"{}:\ "{}"{}XInputWindowsNoCanRunInBackground"{}"{},}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}"{}extend"{}"{}:\ "{}"{}XInputWindows"{}"{},}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ "{}"{}runInBackground"{}"{}:\ "{}"{}off"{}"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{\ \ \ \ \}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}});}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Improved performance of {\ttfamily Touchscreen} by merging consecutive touch move events together. See the events documentation for more information.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+wants\+Initial\+State\+Check} property that allows toggling on initial state checks for {\ttfamily Button} and {\ttfamily Pass-\/\+Through} actions (implicitly enabled for {\ttfamily Value} actions).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This allows responding immediately to controls that are already actuated when the action is enabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new API for more easily listening for event changes. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.onEvent}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ .ForDevice<Gamepad>()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ .Where(e\ =>\ e.HasButtonPress())}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ .CallOnce(e\ =>\ Debug.Log(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Button\ pressed!));}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Added new API to easily listen for button presses on any device. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputSystem.onAnyButtonPress}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ .CallOnce(ctrl\ =>\ Debug.Log(\$\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Button\ '\{ctrl\}'\ pressed"{}}));}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is a simple wrapper around the new API mentioned above.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1082}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Changed}{Changed}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1082}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Application focus handling behavior has been reworked.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When {\ttfamily run\+In\+Background} is off, no action will be taken on focus loss. When focus comes back, all devices will receive a sync request. Those that don\textquotesingle{}t support it will see a "{}soft"{} reset.
\item When {\ttfamily run\+In\+Background} is on (which, when running in the editor, is considered to always be the case), a new setting {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+background\+Behavior} dictates how input is to be handled while the application does not have focus. The default setting of {\ttfamily Reset\+And\+Disable\+Non\+Background\+Devices} will soft-\/reset and disable all devices for which {\ttfamily Input\+Device.\+can\+Run\+In\+Background} is false. While in the background, devices that are flagged as {\ttfamily can\+Run\+In\+Background} will keep running as in the foreground.
\item In the editor, devices other than {\ttfamily Pointer} and {\ttfamily Keyboard} devices (i.\+e. anything not used to operate the editor UI) are now by default routing their input to the Game View regardless of focus. This also fixes the problem of gamepad sticks resetting to {\ttfamily (0,0)} on focus loss (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-gamepad-stick-values-are-cached-when-changing-editor-window-focus}{\texttt{ case 1222305}}).
\item A new setting {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+game\+View\+Focus} has been introduced to determine how Game View focused is handled in the editor with respect to input.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Editor\+: Removed \textquotesingle{}Lock Input to Game View\textquotesingle{} setting in the Input Debugger.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The setting has been replaced by the new \textquotesingle{}Game View Focus\textquotesingle{} project setting.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+default\+Button\+Press\+Point} is now clamped to a minimum value of {\ttfamily 0.\+0001} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/onclick-not-working-when-in-player}{\texttt{ case 1349002}}).
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Device.\+On\+Configuration\+Changed} can now be overridden in derived classes.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} now defers removing pointers for touches by one frame.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is to ensure that {\ttfamily Is\+Pointer\+Over\+Game\+Object} can meaningfully be queried for touches that have happened within the frame -- even if by the time the method is called, a touch has technically already ended (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-ispointerovergameobject-returns-false-when-used-with-a-tap-interaction}{\texttt{ case 1347048}}).
\item More precisely, this means that whereas before a {\ttfamily Pointer\+Exit} and {\ttfamily Pointer\+Up} was received in the same frame, a touch will now see a {\ttfamily Pointer\+Up} in the frame of release but only see a {\ttfamily Pointer\+Exit} in the subsequent frame.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Calling {\ttfamily Event\+System.\+Is\+Pointer\+Over\+Game\+Object()} from within {\ttfamily Input\+Action} callbacks (such as {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+performed}) will now result in a warning.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item UI updates {\itshape after} input and consumes input through {\ttfamily Input\+Action}s as they are processed. Thus, querying UI state from within {\ttfamily Input\+Action} callbacks will query outdated UI state.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed {\ttfamily Tracked\+Pose\+Driver} to use properties of type {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Property} rather than {\ttfamily Input\+Action} to allow more flexibility.
\item Changed quickstart documentation sample to use the Update method instead of Fixed\+Update to show a more correct usage of the {\ttfamily was\+Pressed\+This\+Frame} API.

\item {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture} no longer deletes the {\ttfamily Game\+Object}s in the current scene in its {\ttfamily Tear\+Down} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-inputtestfixture-destroys-test-scene}{\texttt{ case 1286987}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This was added for the sake of the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System}\textquotesingle{}s own tests but should not have been in the public fixture.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Generic {\ttfamily Gamepad} now has platform independent long button names. Previously it used different names if editor targeted PS4/\+Switch consoles (case 1321676).
\item When creating a new control scheme with a name {\ttfamily All Control Schemes}, {\ttfamily All Control Schemes1} will be created to avoid confusion with implicit {\ttfamily All Control Schemes} scheme (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/control-scheme-cannot-be-selected-when-it-is-named-all-control-schemes}{\texttt{ case 1217379}}).
\item Display names of keyboard buttons are now passed through {\ttfamily To\+Lower} and {\ttfamily To\+Title\+Case} to enforce consistent casing between different platforms and keyboard layouts (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-display-names-for-keyboard-keys-in-the-input-debugger-do-not-match-those-defined-in-input-system-package}{\texttt{ case 1254705}}).
\item Editor\+: All remaining {\ttfamily Input\+User} instances are now removed automatically when exiting play mode. This means that all devices are automatically unpaired.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In essence, like {\ttfamily Input\+Action}, {\ttfamily Input\+User} is now considered a player-\/only feature.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Events queued {\bfseries{during}} event processing (i.\+e. {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Update()}) are now processed in the same frame. This eliminates the 1-\/frame lag previously incurred by simulated input.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Note that this does not extend to input queued {\bfseries{outside}} of event processing but in the same frame. For example, input queued by the UI (such as by {\ttfamily On\+Screen\+Button} and {\ttfamily On\+Screen\+Stick}) will still see a 1-\/frame lag as UI event processing happens later in the frame and outside of input event processing.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed inputs in game view sometimes not working when running in the editor, as initial focus state could end up being incorrect.
\item Fixed bad performance in Input Debugger with high-\/frequency devices (e.\+g. 1+ KHz gaming mice). Before, high event volumes led to excessive refreshes of debugger data.
\item Fixed compile error on tv\+OS due to step counter support for i\+OS added in {\ttfamily 1.\+1.\+0-\/preview.\+3}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for Device Simulator touchscreen input.
\item Enabled XR device support on Magic Leap (Lumin).
\item Added ability to force XR Support in a project by defining {\ttfamily UNITY\+\_\+\+INPUT\+\_\+\+FORCE\+\_\+\+XR\+\_\+\+PLUGIN}.
\item Added a warning message to Player\+Input\+Manager editor when the attached input action asset won\textquotesingle{}t work with Join Players When Button Is Pressed behaviour due to missing control scheme device requirements (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-player-prefabs-are-not-instantiated-on-join-action-when-they-have-inputactionasset-assigned-to-them}{\texttt{ case 1265853}}).
\item Added support for \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html}{\texttt{ UI Toolkit}} with \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} 2021.\+1+.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item UITK is now supported as a UI solution in players. Input support for both \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/com.unity.ugui.html}{\texttt{ Unity UI}} and \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIElements.html}{\texttt{ UI Toolkit}} is based on the same {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} code path. More details in the manual.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} now has an {\ttfamily xr\+Tracking\+Origin} property. When assigned, this will transform all tracked device positions and rotations from it\textquotesingle{}s local space into \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity}\textquotesingle{}s world space (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/xr-sdk-tracked-device-raycaster-does-not-work-correctly-with-worldspace-canvas-when-xr-camera-is-offset-from-origin}{\texttt{ case 1308480}}).
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module.\+Get\+Last\+Raycast\+Result}. This returns the most recent raycast result and can be used to draw ray visualizations or get information on the most recent UI object hit.
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+State\+Block} support for {\ttfamily k\+Format\+SBit} when working with floats (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/hid-exceptions-are-thrown-when-launching-a-project-while-analog-keyboard-is-connected-to-the-machine}{\texttt{ case 1258003}}).

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Can, for example, be used with {\ttfamily Input\+Binding.\+path}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new API-\/only setting in the form of {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings.\+max\+Event\+Bytes\+Per\+Update}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Puts an upper limit on the number of event bytes processed in a single update.
\item If exceeded, any additional event data will get thrown away and an error will be issued.
\item Set to 5MB by default.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a new API-\/only setting called {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings.\+max\+Queued\+Events\+Per\+Update}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This limits the number of events that can be queued during event processing using the {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Queue\+Event} method. This guards against infinite loops in the case where an action callback queues an event that causes the same action callback to be called again.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module.\+Assign\+Default\+Actions} to assign default actions when creating ui module in runtime.
\item Added {\ttfamily UNITY\+\_\+\+INCLUDE\+\_\+\+TESTS} define constraints to our test assemblies, which is 2019.\+2+ equivalent to {\ttfamily "{}optional\+Unity\+References"{}\+: \mbox{[}"{}\+Test\+Assemblies"{}\mbox{]}}.

\item The most complex device we have at the moment ({\ttfamily Touchscreen}) has 242 controls and 616 bytes of state.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Touch\+Simulation} now {\bfseries{disables}} the {\ttfamily Pointer} devices it reads input from.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is to address the problem of mouse input leading to {\bfseries{both}} mouse and touch input happening concurrently. Instead, enabling touch simulation will now effectively {\bfseries{replace}} mouse and pen input with touch input.
\item Devices such {\ttfamily Mouse} and {\ttfamily Pen} will remain in place but will not get updated. Events received for them will be consumed by {\ttfamily Touch\+Simulation}.

\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Device.\+can\+Run\+In\+Background} not being correctly set for VR devices (thus not allowing them to receive input while the application is not focused).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+User.\+On\+Event} and {\ttfamily Rebinding\+Operation.\+On\+Event} exhibiting bad performance profiles and leading to multi-\/millisecond input update times (case 1253371).
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}Fixed actions not triggering correctly when multiple bindings on the same action were referencing the same control (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues/guid/1293808/}{\texttt{ case 1293808}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bindings will now "{}claim"{} controls during resolution. If several bindings {\bfseries{on the same action}} resolve to the same control, only the first such binding will successfully resolve to the control. Subsequent bindings will only resolve to controls not already referenced by other bindings on the action. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ action\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ InputAction();}

\DoxyCodeLine{action.AddBinding(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}<Gamepad>/button*"{}});\ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Will\ only\ receive\ buttonWest,\ buttonEast,\ and\ buttonNorth.}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item This also means that {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+controls} will now only contain any control at most once.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Fixed JSON serialization of action maps not preserving empty binding paths (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/cloning-actionmap-through-json-converts-empty-paths-to-null-which-is-not-allowed}{\texttt{ case 1231968}}).\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1094}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Added}{Added}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1094}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Dual\+Shock4\+Gamepad\+Android and Xbox\+One\+Gamepad\+Android layout for Android
\item Added a new high-\/performance way to iterate over changed controls in an event.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\ttfamily submit} and the {\ttfamily cancel} actions of the UI input module now trigger on {\bfseries{release}} instead of press. This makes the behavior consistent with clicks triggering UI response on release rather than press.
\item Removed the old "{}\+Tanks"{} demo (previously available from the samples shipped with the package).
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Actions of type {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Type.\+Button} now respect button press (and release) points.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously, button-\/type actions, when used without explicit "{}\+Press"{} interactions, would perform immediately when a bound control was actuated.
\item Now, a button-\/type action will behave the same as if a "{}\+Press"{} interaction is applied with "{}\+Trigger Behavior"{} set to "{}\+Press Only"{}.
\item This means that a button-\/type action will now perform (and perform {\bfseries{once}} only) when a control crosses the button press threshold defined in the global settings or, if present, locally on a {\ttfamily Button\+Control}. It will then stay performed and finally cancel only when the control falls back to or below the release threshold.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}()} now always returns {\ttfamily default\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} when the action is canceled.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is to make it consistent with {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Callback\+Context.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}()} which already returned {\ttfamily default\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} when the action was canceled.
\item In general, all APIs that read values will return default values when an action is in a phase other than {\ttfamily Started} or {\ttfamily Performed}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If multiple actions in different action maps but in the same .inputactions asset have the same name, calling {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset.\+Find\+Action()} with just an action name will now return the first {\bfseries{enabled}} action. If none of the actions are enabled, it will return the first action with a matching name as before (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-action-can-only-be-triggered-by-one-of-the-action-maps-when-action-name-is-identical}{\texttt{ case 1207550}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed player build causing {\ttfamily Project\+Settings.\+asset} to be checked out in Perforce (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/projectsettings-dot-asset-is-checked-out-in-perforce-when-building-a-project-with-the-input-system-package-installed}{\texttt{ case 1254502}}).
\item Fixed player build corrupting preloaded asset list in {\ttfamily Player\+Settings} if it was modified by another build processor.
\item Fixed remoting in Input Debugger not working for devices in the player that are created from generated layouts (such as XR devices).
\item Fixed potential {\ttfamily Null\+Reference\+Exception} in {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Property} when the {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference} is {\ttfamily null}.
\item Fixed "{}\+On-\/\+Screen Controls"{} sample still using {\ttfamily Standalone\+Input\+Module} and thus throwing {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exception} when used with "{}\+Active Input Handling"{} set to "{}\+Input System Package (\+New)"{} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-old-input-module-is-available-in-onscreencontrolssample-sample-scene-from-package}{\texttt{ case 1201866}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily On\+Screen\+Button} leaving button controls in pressed state when disabled in-\/between receiving {\ttfamily On\+Pointer\+Down} and {\ttfamily On\+Pointer\+Up}. Usually manifested itself by having to click the button twice next time it was enabled.
\item Fixed exiting out of play mode in the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Editor while a test run is in progress leading to the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} permanently losing all its state until the editor is restarted (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/the-input-system-does-not-get-re-enabled-when-a-playmode-input-test-is-interrupted}{\texttt{ case 1251724}}).
\item Fixed max values for {\ttfamily Axis} and {\ttfamily Double} controls stored as multi-\/bit fields being off by one (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/value-equal-to-1-is-not-returned-by-the-input-system-when-reading-a-multi-bit-control}{\texttt{ case 1223436}}).

\item Fixed debug assert in {\ttfamily Input\+Device\+Tester} sample when simultaneously pressing two buttons on gamepad (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-runtime-errors-when-pressing-more-than-one-button-at-the-same-time}{\texttt{ case 1244988}}).
\item Fixed use of UI {\ttfamily Slider} causing drag thresholds to no longer work (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-drag-threshold-value-is-ignored-for-scroll-view-after-interacting-with-a-slider-slash-scroll-bar}{\texttt{ case 1275834}}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed Action with multiple bindings becoming unresponsive after a Hold interaction was performed (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-hold-interaction-makes-an-input-action-unresponsive-when-2-or-more-binding-are-attached-to-the-same-input-action}{\texttt{ case 1239551}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Null\+Reference\+Exception} when {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Input} component {\ttfamily Create Action} is pressed and saved (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-nullreferenceexception-is-thrown-when-player-input-component-create-action-is-pressed-and-saved}{\texttt{ case 1245921}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Trace.\+Action\+Event\+Ptr.\+Read\+Value\+As\+Object} leading to {\ttfamily Invalid\+Cast\+Exception} when trying to read values that came from composite bindings.
\item Fixed not being able to stack a {\ttfamily Multi\+Tap} on top of a {\ttfamily Tap} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/multi-tap-and-tap-interactions-in-the-same-action-doesnt-work-properly}{\texttt{ case 1261462}}).
\item Fixed rebinds triggered by the Enter key causing stuck Enter key states (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-rebind-action-requires-two-inputs-slash-presses-when-using-the-enter-key}{\texttt{ case 1271591}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Map index on trigger} and {\ttfamily Index\+Out\+Of\+Range\+Exception} errors when using multiple Interactions on the same Action. (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/map-index-on-trigger-and-indexoutofrangeexception-errors-when-using-multiple-interactions-on-the-same-action}{\texttt{ case 1253034}}).
\item Fixed context menu in action editor not filtering out composites the same way that the {\ttfamily +} icon menu does. This led to, for example, a "{}2\+D Vector"{} composite being shown as an option for a button type action.
\item Fixed initial state checks for composite bindings failing if performed repeatedly. For example, doing a {\ttfamily Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Vector2\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} for a WASD binding would return an incorrect value after disabling the map twice while no input from the keyboard was received (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-cannot-read-vector2-values-after-inputactionset-has-been-disabled-and-enabled-twice}{\texttt{ case 1274977}}).
\item Fixed "{}\+Add Interaction"{} menu in action editor not filtering out interactions with incompatible value types (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/new-input-system-action-gets-called-only-once-when-using-mouse-press-interaction}{\texttt{ case 1272772}}).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Player\+Input} no longer auto-\/switching control schemes if {\ttfamily never\+Auto\+Switch\+Control\+Schemes} was toggled off and back on after the component was first enabled (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-auto-switch-locks-on-one-device-when-its-disabled-and-re-enabled-via-script}{\texttt{ case 1232039}}).
\item Fixed action map name being the same as .inputactions asset name leading to compile errors when {\ttfamily Generate C\# Class} is used; now leads to import error (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-user-can-name-inputaction-asset-and-action-map-the-same-creating-compilation-errors-on-generation}{\texttt{ case 1212052}}).
\item Fixed bindings not getting updated when binding by display name and there is no control with the given display name initially.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added "{}release thresholds"{} for buttons.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Release points are now separated from press points by a percentage threshold.
\item The threshold is defined by {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+button\+Release\+Threshold}.
\item Thresholds are defined as percentages of press points. A release is thus defined as a button, after having reached a value of at least {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+default\+Button\+Press\+Point} (or whatever local press is used), falling back to a value equal to or less than {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+button\+Release\+Threshold} percent of the press point.
\item This is intended to solve the problem of buttons flickering around button press points.
\item The default threshold is set at 75\%, that is, buttons release at 3/4 of the press point.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added new methods to the {\ttfamily Input\+Action} class\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Is\+Pressed()}\+: Whether a bound control has crossed the press threshold and has not yet fallen back below the release threshold.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Was\+Pressed\+This\+Frame()}\+: Whether a bound control has crossed the press threshold this frame.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Was\+Released\+This\+Frame()}\+: Whether a bound control has fallen back below the release threshold this frame.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Was\+Performed\+This\+Frame()}\+: Whether the action was performed at any point during the current frame. Equivalent to {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+triggered}, which will be deprecated in the future.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Reset()}\+: Forcibly reset the action state. Cancels the action, if it is currently in progress.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Get\+Timeout\+Completion\+Percentage} to query the amount left to complete a currently ongoing interaction. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Let's\ say\ there's\ a\ hold\ interaction\ on\ a\ "{}warp"{}\ action.\ The\ user\ presses\ a\ button\ bound}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ to\ the\ action\ and\ then\ holds\ it.\ While\ the\ user\ holds\ the\ button,\ we\ want\ to\ know\ how\ much}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ longer\ the\ user\ will\ have\ to\ hold\ it\ so\ that\ we\ can\ display\ feedback\ in\ the\ UI.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ holdCompleted\ =\ playerInput.actions[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}warp"{}}].GetTimeoutCompletionPercentage();}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Added three new binding composite types\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily One\+Modifier\+Composite}\+: This is a generalization of {\ttfamily Button\+With\+One\+Modifier} (which is still available but now hidden from the UI) which also represents bindings such as "{}\+SHIFT+1"{} but now can be used to target bindings other than buttons (e.\+g. "{}\+SHIFT+delta"{}).
\item {\ttfamily Two\+Modifiers\+Composite}\+: This is a generalization of {\ttfamily Button\+With\+Two\+Modifiers} (which is still available but now hidden from the UI) which also represents bindings such as "{}\+SHIFT+\+CTRL+1"{} but now can be used to target bindings other than buttons (e.\+g. "{}\+SHIFT+\+CTRL+delta"{}).
\item {\ttfamily Vector3\+Composite}\+: Works the same way {\ttfamily Vector2\+Composite} does. Adds a {\ttfamily forward} and {\ttfamily backward} binding in addition to {\ttfamily up}, {\ttfamily down}, {\ttfamily left}, and {\ttfamily right}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Auto-\/generated C\# files now have {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}auto-\/generated\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} headers so they get ignored by \doxylink{namespace_rider}{Rider} code analysis.
\item Auto-\/generated C\# classes are now {\ttfamily partial} so that they can be manually extended.
\item Deleting a composite binding with {\ttfamily action.\+Change\+Binding(0).Erase()} now also erases all the bindings that are part of the composite.
\item Trigger binding resolution from within action callbacks (e.\+g. {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+performed}) will now defer resolution until after the callback has completed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This fixes crashes such as \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/mecanim-crash-when-entering-or-exiting-play-mode-destroying-gameobjects}{\texttt{ case 1242406}} where disabling {\ttfamily Player\+Input} from within an action callback led to an action\textquotesingle{}s state being released while the action was still in a callback.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed input history on Android mono build by alligning memory of history records
\item Fixed no input being processed when running a {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Unity\+Test\mbox{]}} over several frames. Before, this required calling {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Update} manually.
\item Fixed clicking on help page button in \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} inspector for Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} components not going to relevant manual pages.
\item Fixed a bug that prevented Dual\+Shock controllers from working on tv\+OS. (case 1221223).

\item Fixed sequential taps causing touches to get stuck in {\ttfamily Touch.\+active\+Touches}.
\item Improved performance of {\ttfamily Touch.\+active\+Touches} (most notably, a lot of time was spent in endlessly repetitive safety checks).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Enhanced\+Touch} APIs not indicating that they need to be enabled with {\ttfamily Enhanced\+Touch\+Support.\+Enable()}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The APIs now throw {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exception} when used without being enabled.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Controls are now re-\/resolved after adding or removing bindings from actions (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-package-does-not-re-resolve-bindings-when-adding-a-new-binding-to-a-map-that-has-already-generated-its-state}{\texttt{ case 1218544}}).
\item Can now have spaces and special characters in action names when using {\ttfamily Player\+Input} with the {\ttfamily Send\+Messages} or {\ttfamily Broadcast\+Messages} behavior. Previously, an incorrect method name was generated (fix contributed by \href{https://github.com/BHSPitMonkey}{\texttt{ BHSPit\+Monkey}} in \href{https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/InputSystem/pull/1022}{\texttt{ \#1022}}; \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/player-input-send-messages-wont-trigger-when-input-action-name-contains-spaces}{\texttt{ case 1214519}}).
\item Adding a new action now sets {\ttfamily expected\+Control\+Type} to {\ttfamily Button} as expected (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-default-value-of-expectedcontroltype-is-not-being-set-when-creating-a-new-action}{\texttt{ case 1221015}}).
\item \doxylink{class_player}{Player} joins with {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} from button presses no longer fail if there are multiple devices of the same type present and the join was not on the first gamepad (\href{https://fogbugz.unity3d.com/f/cases/1226920/}{\texttt{ case 226920}}).
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Editor} no longer leads to the player\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset} mistakenly getting replaced with a clone when the inspector is open on a {\ttfamily Player\+Input} component (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/action-map-gets-lost-on-play-when-prefab-is-highlighted-in-inspector}{\texttt{ case 1228636}}).
\item The control picker in the .inputactions editor will no longer incorrectly filter out layouts such as {\ttfamily Xbox One Gamepad (on XB1)} when using them in control schemes. Also, it will no longer filter out controls from base layouts (such as {\ttfamily Gamepad}) (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/impossible-to-choose-gamepad-as-binding-path-when-control-scheme-is-set-as-xboxone-scheme}{\texttt{ case 1219415}}).
\item {\ttfamily Rebind\+Operation}s will no longer pick controls right away that are already actuated above the magnitude threshold when the operation starts. Instead, these controls will have to change their actuation from their initial level such that they cross the magnitude threshold configured in the operation (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unnecessary-slash-unwanted-binding-candidates-are-found-when-detecting-and-changing-an-input-value-of-an-input-device}{\texttt{ case 1215784}}).
\item Newly added actions and action maps are now scrolled to when there are more items than fit into view. Previously newly added item was appended but outside of the visible area.
\item Actions and bindings in the {\ttfamily .inputactions} editor are no longer force-\/expanded on every domain reload and whenever a new action or binding is added.
\item The importer for {\ttfamily .inputactions} assets will now check out from version control the generated .cs file when overwriting it -- which only happens if the contents differ (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-editor-generated-c-number-file-is-not-checked-out-when-overwriting}{\texttt{ case 1222972}}).
\item The editor for {\ttfamily .inputactions} assets will now check out from version control the asset before saving it.
\item Drag-\/reordering action maps no longer throws "{}\+Should have drop target"{} asserts in the console (case \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-reordering-of-actionmaps-in-input-action-window-fails-and-throws-should-have-drop-target-error}{\texttt{ 1229146}}).
\item Drag-\/reordering actions no longer changes action IDs of some of the existing actions (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-systems-action-ids-dont-stick-with-action-names-when-input-actions-are-reorganized}{\texttt{ case 1231233}}).
\item References to {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference} objects created by the importer for {\ttfamily .inputactions} files are no longer broken when the action referenced by the object is renamed (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/inputsystem-inputactionreference-loses-guid-when-its-action-is-moved-or-renamed-in-the-inputaction-asset}{\texttt{ case 1229145}}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{NOTE\+: This fix does not apply to existing {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference} instances.}} The problem was inherent in the internal file IDs generated for actions -- which were affected by action and map names. Thus, changing the name of an action or map would change the resulting file ID of the {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference}.~\newline
However, changing file IDs will break any existing reference to the object. Thus we had to preserve the existing {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference} objects under their original file ID. We hide them in the Project Browser, however. The ones that are visible now have the new, fixed file IDs.~\newline
To switch existing {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference} properties to the new file IDs, simply replace them with the newly created {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Reference}.

\item Leaving play mode no longer leaves state change monitors lingering around from enabled actions.

\item There were no enforced rules about how an action would go through {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+started}, {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+performed}, and {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+canceled}. Which of the callbacks were triggered and in what order depended on a number of factors, the biggest influencer of which were the different interactions that could be applied to actions (like {\ttfamily Press} or {\ttfamily Hold}).
\item This made for unpredictable and frequently surprising results. In addition, it led to bugs where, for \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-ui-becomes-unresponsive-after-the-first-ui-button-press}{\texttt{ example}}, adding a {\ttfamily Press} interaction to the {\ttfamily Click} action of {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} would cause the click state to get stuck because the click action would never cancel.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Now}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The system will now {\itshape always} trigger {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+started} first. If this is not done explicitly, it happens implicitly.
\item Likewise, the system will now {\itshape always} trigger {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+canceled} before going back to waiting state. Like with {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+started}, if this isn\textquotesingle{}t done explicitly, it will happen implicitly. This implies that {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+canceled} no longer signifies an action getting aborted because it stopped after it started but before it performed. It now simply means "{}the action has ended"{} whether it actually got performed or not.
\item In-\/between {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+started} and {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+canceled}, {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+performed} may be triggered arbitrary many times (including not at all).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item While late in the cycle for 1.\+0, we\textquotesingle{}ve opted to make this change now in order to fix a range of bugs and problems we\textquotesingle{}ve observed that people encountered because of the previous behavior of the system.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Related to the change above, the behavior of {\ttfamily Press\+Interaction} has been tweaked and now is the following\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Press Only}\+: Starts and immediately performs when pressed, then stays performed and cancels when button is released.
\item {\ttfamily Release Only}\+: Starts when button is pressed and then performs and immediately cancels when the button is released.
\item {\ttfamily Press And Release}\+: Starts and immediately performs when button is pressed, then stays performed and performs again and immediately cancels when button is released.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Vector2\+Composite} now has a {\ttfamily mode} parameter which can be used to choose between {\ttfamily Digital\+Normalized} (the default), {\ttfamily Digital} (same as {\ttfamily Digital\+Normalized} but does not normalize the resulting vector), and {\ttfamily Analog} (uses float input values as is).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Vector2\+Composite.\+normalize} has been deprecated. Note that it will not work together with {\ttfamily Analog}. The parameter will be removed in the future.

\item XR controllers and HMDs have proper display names in the UI again. This regressed in preview.\+4 such that all XR controllers were displayed as just "{}\+XR Controller"{} in the UI and all HMDs were displayed as "{}\+XR HMD"{}.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} no longer generates GC heap garbage every time mouse events are processed.
\item Fixed a bug where an internal array helper method was corrupting array contents leading to bugs in both {\ttfamily Input\+User} and {\ttfamily Touch}.
\item Fixed exception when saving changes to an Input Action asset and the parent directory has been renamed.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The regression in 1.\+0.\+0-\/preview.\+4 of {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} not joining players correctly if a scheme has more than one device requirement has been fixed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This most notably manifested itself with keyboard+mouse control schemes.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} will no longer join players when control schemes are used and none of the schemes produces a successful match based on the devices available for the join.
\item When no action map is selected in action editor, plus icon to add an action is now disabled; formerly threw an exception when clicked (case 1199562).
\item Removing a callback from actions from the callback itself no longer throws {\ttfamily Argument\+Out\+Of\+Range\+Exception} (\href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/input-system-package-argumentoutofrangeexception-error-is-thrown-when-the-callback-is-removed-while-its-being-triggered}{\texttt{ case 1192972}}).

\item The list of device requirements for a control scheme in the action editor no longer displays devices with their internal layout name rather than their external display name.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We\textquotesingle{}ve added a new {\ttfamily Simple Multiplayer} sample which demonstrates a simple, bare-\/bones local multiplayer setup.
\item We\textquotesingle{}ve also added a {\ttfamily Gamepad Mouse Cursor} sample that shows how to drive a UI mouse cursor using the gamepad.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The sample contains a reusable {\ttfamily Virtual\+Mouse\+Input} component that does most of the work.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a {\ttfamily Deselect On Background Click} option to {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module}. This allows toggling the behavior off where clicking the mouse and not hitting a {\ttfamily Game\+Object} will automatically clear the current selection -- which will break keyboard and gamepad navigation.

This release includes a number of Quality-\/of-\/\+Life improvements for a range of common problems that users have reported.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1127}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Added}{Added}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1127}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To aid in debugging issues, we\textquotesingle{}ve extended the system\textquotesingle{}s event tracing and replay functionality to allow persisting and replaying arbitrary input event streams.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Event\+Trace} now has APIs to persist the events to disk and to load them back in from previously persisted event streams. The same API can be used to persist in arbitrary C\# {\ttfamily Stream} instances, not just in file streams. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Write.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{myTrace.WriteTo(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}file.inputtrace"{}});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Read.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputEventTrace.LoadFrom(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}file.inputtrace"{}});}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item {\ttfamily Input\+Event\+Trace} now has built-\/in replay functionality. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myTrace.Replay().PlayAllFramesOneByOne();}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item The event trace in device windows of the Input Debugger has been extended with controls to save and load traces.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item We\textquotesingle{}ve added a new {\ttfamily Input\+Recording} sample which has a reusable {\ttfamily Mono\+Behaviour} component that can be used to capture and replay device activity.
\item {\ttfamily Keyboard} now has a {\ttfamily Find\+Key\+On\+Current\+Keyboard\+Layout} method to look up key controls by their display names.
\item Keyboards now have synthetic controls that combine left and right variants of modifier keys.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means that you can bind to just "{}shift"{} now, for example, instead of having to bind to both "{}left shift"{} and "{}right shift"{}. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{new}\ InputAction(binding:\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}<Keyboard>/shift"{}});}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item The controls are also available as properties on {\ttfamily Keyboard}. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordflow}{if}\ (Keyboard.current.shiftKey.isPressed)\ \textcolor{comment}{/*\ ...\ */};}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input} now has a new {\ttfamily Controls Changed} event/message which is triggered when the control setup of the player changes (e.\+g. when switching control schemes). 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{public}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ OnControlsChanged()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ Update\ UI\ display\ hints,\ for\ example...}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item We\textquotesingle{}ve added APIs to simplify turning bindings into strings suitable for display in UIs. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Takes\ things\ such\ as\ currently\ bound\ controls\ and\ active\ binding\ masks\ into\ account}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ and\ can\ handle\ composites.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{action.GetBindingDisplayString();}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Related to this, custom binding composites can now be annotated with the new {\ttfamily Display\+String\+Format} attribute to control how composites as a whole are turned into display strings. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{[DisplayStringFormat(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}\{button\}+\{stick\}"{}})]}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{public}\ \textcolor{keyword}{class\ }MyComposite\ :\ InputBindingComposite<Vector2>}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ [InputControl(layout\ =\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Button"{}})]\ \textcolor{keyword}{public}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ button;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ [InputControl(layout\ =\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Stick"{}})]\ \textcolor{keyword}{public}\ \textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ stick;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Rebinding\+Extension.\+Rebinding\+Operation} has a new configuration method {\ttfamily With\+Matching\+Events\+Being\+Suppressed} which allows suitable input events to automatically be swallowed while a rebind is ongoing. This greatly helps with not having something else respond to input while a rebind is in progress.
\item We\textquotesingle{}ve added two new samples\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Rebinding UI}}\+: Demonstrates how to create a rebinding screen using the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System}\textquotesingle{}s APIs. The sample also includes a reusable prefab you can use directly in your projects to quickly put rebinding screens together.
\item {\bfseries{In-\/\+Game Hints}}\+: Demonstrates how to show context-\/sensitive help that respects the current control scheme.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1129}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Changed}{Changed}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1129}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The logic for resetting devices on focus loss has changed somewhat\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When focus is lost, all devices are forcibly reset to their default state. As before, a {\ttfamily Request\+Reset\+Command} for each device is also sent to the backend but regardless of whether the device responds or not, the input state for the device will be overwritten to default.
\item {\bfseries{Noisy controls are exempted from resets}}. The assumption here is that noisy controls most often represent sensor readings of some kind (e.\+g. tracking data) and snapping the values back to their default will usually
\item If {\ttfamily Application.\+run\+In\+Background} is {\ttfamily true}, all devices that return {\ttfamily true} from {\ttfamily Input\+Device.\+can\+Run\+In\+Background} are exempted from resets entirely. This, for example, allows XR devices to continue running regardless of focus change.
\item This fixes problems such as keyboard keys getting stuck when alt-\/tabbing between applications (case 1206199).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Extensions.\+Get\+State\+Ptr\+From\+State\+Event} no longer throws {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exception} when the state format for the event does not match that of the device. It simply returns {\ttfamily null} instead (same as when control is found in the event\textquotesingle{}s state).
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Event\+Trace} instances are no longer disposed automatically from their finalizer but {\bfseries{MUST}} be disposed of explicitly using {\ttfamily Dispose()}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This is to allow event traces to survive domain reloads. If they are disposed of automatically during finalizers, even if they survive the reload, the next GC will cause traces to be deallocated.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1130}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Actions}{Actions}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1130}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Rebinding\+Extensions.\+Perform\+Interactive\+Rebinding} has been greatly enhanced to apply a wide range of default configurations to the rebind. This greatly reduces the need to manually configure the resulting rebind. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{comment}{//\ Start\ a\ rebind\ with\ the\ default\ configuration.}}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAction.PerformInteractiveRebinding().Start();}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Pointer position input will be ignored by default.
\item If not a suitable binding target itself, {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Keyboard\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/escape} will automatically be made to quit the rebind.
\item Events with control input not explicitly matching exclusions will now get suppressed. This prevents input actions from getting triggered while a rebind is in progress.
\item The expected control type is automatically adjusted if a part binding of a composite is targeted by the rebind (e.\+g. if the action expects a {\ttfamily Vector2} but the part binding expects a {\ttfamily Button}, the rebind switches automatically to {\ttfamily Button}).
\item If the targeted binding is part of a control scheme, controls will automatically be restricted to match the device requirements of the control scheme. For example, if the binding belongs to a "{}\+Keyboard\&\+Mouse"{} scheme that has {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Keyboard\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} and a {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Mouse\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} requirement, the rebind will ignore input on gamepads.
\item As before, you can always create a {\ttfamily Rebinding\+Operation} from scratch yourself or wipe/alter the configuration returned by {\ttfamily Perform\+Interactive\+Rebinding} however you see fit.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Control schemes can now handle ambiguity.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This means that, for example, you can now have one control scheme for generic gamepads and another control scheme specifically for PS4 controllers and the system will reliably pick the PS4 scheme when a PS4 controller is used and fall back to the generic gamepad scheme otherwise.
\item While this is exposed as a new {\ttfamily score} property on {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Scheme.\+Match\+Result}, no code changes are necessary to take advantage of this feature.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input.\+active} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Player\+Input.\+input\+Is\+Active} to avoid ambiguities with {\ttfamily Game\+Object} activation.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1131}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Fixed}{Fixed}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_c_h_a_n_g_e_l_o_g_autotoc_md1131}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+User} in combination with touchscreens no longer throws {\ttfamily Invalid\+Operation\+Exception} complaining about incorrect state format.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In a related change, {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Extensions.\+Get\+State\+Ptr\+From\+State\+Event} now works with touch events, too.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Stack overflow in {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture.\+current\+Time} getter.
\item Input that occurs in-\/between pressing the play button and the game starting no longer leaks into the game (case 1191342).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This usually manifested itself as large accumulated mouse deltas leading to such effects as the camera immediately jerking around on game start.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removing a device no longer has the potential of corrupting state change monitors (and thus actions getting triggered) from other devices.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This bug led to input being missed on a device once another device had been removed.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Tracked\+Device} layout is no longer incorrectly registered as {\ttfamily Tracked Device}.
\item Event traces in the input debugger are no longer lost on domain reloads.
\item {\ttfamily Index\+Out\+Of\+Range\+Exception} being thrown when looking up controls on XR devices.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Clicking the "{}\+Replace with Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module"{} button in the inspector when looking at {\ttfamily Standalone\+Input\+Module}, the resulting operation is now undoable and will properly dirty the scene.

\item Fixed missing keyboard bindings in {\ttfamily Default\+Input\+Actions.\+inputactions} for navigation in UI.
\item Fixed using C\# reserved names in .inputactions assets leading to compile errors in generated C\# classes (case 1189861).
\item Assigning a new {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset} to a {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} will no longer look up action names globally but rather only look for actions that are located in action maps with the same name.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously, if you e.\+g. switched from one asset where the {\ttfamily point} action was bound to {\ttfamily UI/\+Point} to an asset that had no {\ttfamily UI} action map but did have an action called {\ttfamily Point} somewhere else, it would erroneously pick the most likely unrelated {\ttfamily Point} action for use by the UI.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed missing custom editors for {\ttfamily Axis\+Deadzone\+Processor} and {\ttfamily Stick\+Deadzone\+Processor} that link {\ttfamily min} and {\ttfamily max} values to input settings.
\item Fixed actions ending up being disabled if switching to a control scheme that has no binding for the action (case 1187377).
\item Fixed part of composite not being bound leading to subsequent part bindings not being functional (case 1189867).
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Player\+Input} not pairing devices added after it was enabled when not having control schemes.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This problem would also show in the {\ttfamily Simple\+Demo} sample when having the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_custom_device_usages}{Custom\+Device\+Usages}} sample installed as well. Gamepads would not get picked up in that case.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Argument\+Null\+Exception} when adding a device and a binding in an action map had an empty path (case 1187163).
\item Fixed bindings that are not associated with any control scheme not getting enabled with other control schemes as they should.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Generated action wrappers now won\textquotesingle{}t {\ttfamily Destroy} the generated Asset in a finalizer, but instead implement {\ttfamily IDisposable}.
\item Added back XR layouts (except for Magic Leap) that were removed for {\ttfamily 1.\+0-\/preview}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed these layouts under the assumption that they would almost concurrently become available in the respective device-\/specific XR packages. However, this did not work out as expected and the gap here turned out to be more than what we anticipated.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug where the Input Settings Window might throw exceptions after assembly reload.
\item Correctly implemented {\ttfamily Is\+Pointer\+Over\+Game\+Object} method for {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module}.
\item Several bugs with layout overrides registered with ({\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Register\+Layout\+Overrides}).
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In {\ttfamily 1.\+0-\/preview}, layout overrides could lead to corruption of the layout state and would also not be handled correctly by the various editor UIs.

\item Selecting a layout in the input debugger no longer selects its first child item, too.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a bug where multiple composite bindings for the same controls but on different action maps would throw exceptions.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily any\+Key} not appearing in control picker for {\ttfamily Keyboard}.
\item The text on the "{}\+Listen"{} button is no longer clipped off on 2019.\+3.
\item Controls bound to actions through composites no longer show up as duplicates in the input debugger.
\item Fixed "{}\+Create Actions..."{} on {\ttfamily Player\+Input} creating an asset with an incorrect binding for taps on Touchscreens. \textbackslash{} {\bfseries{NOTE\+: If you have already created an .inputactions asset with this mechanism, update "{}tap \mbox{[}\+Touchscreen\mbox{]}"{} to "{}\+Primary Touch/\+Tap"{} to fix the problem manually.}}
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Invoke CSharp Events} when selected in {\ttfamily Player\+Input} not triggering {\ttfamily Player\+Input.\+on\+Action\+Triggered}.

\item Fixed pointer coordinates in editor windows for non-\/mouse pointing devices.
\item Fixed using the input system in il2cpp when managed stripping level is set higher then "{}\+Low"{}.
\item Device debugger window will still show when reading from specific controls throws exceptions.
\item Offsets and sizes for elements on Linux joysticks are now computed correctly.
\item Joysticks now have a deadzone processor on the stick itself.
\item Up/down/left/right on sticks are now deadzoned just like X and Y on sticks are.
\item Removed toplevel {\ttfamily X} and {\ttfamily Y} controls on HIDs when there is a {\ttfamily Stick/X} and {\ttfamily Stick/Y} added for the device.
\item HID fallback can now deal with sticks that have X and Y controls of different sizes and sitting in non-\/contiguous locations in the HID input report.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Binding paths now show the same way in the action editor UI as they do in the control picker.

\item Control scheme names can no longer be set to empty strings.
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input.\+Instantiate} now correctly sets up a given control scheme, if specified.
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Touch support has been reworked and extended.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+touch\mbox{[}0..9\mbox{]}} are now bindable from the control picker.
\item {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+primary\+Touch} is now a separate control which tracks the primary touch on the screen.
\item The controls {\ttfamily Touchscreen} inherits from {\ttfamily Pointer} (such as {\ttfamily position}, {\ttfamily phase}, and {\ttfamily delta}) are now tied to {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+primary\+Touch} and allow for {\ttfamily Touchscreen} to function as a generic {\ttfamily Pointer} (like {\ttfamily Mouse} and {\ttfamily Pen}).
\item {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+press} (renamed from {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+button}) is now a working, synthetic button that is down whenever at least one finger is on the screen.
\item Recording of start time and start position has been added to touches.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Touch\+Control.\+start\+Position} gives the starting position of the touch.
\item {\ttfamily Touch\+Control.\+start\+Time} gives the starting time of the touch.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Tap detection has been added to {\ttfamily Touchscreen}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Tap time (i.\+e. time within which a press-\/and-\/release must be completed for a tap to register) corresponds to {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+default\+Tap\+Time}.
\item Tap release must happen within a certain radius of first contact. This is determined by a new setting {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+tap\+Radius}.
\item {\ttfamily Touch\+Control.\+tap} is a new button control that triggers then the touch is tapped. Note that this happens instantly when a touch ends. The button will go to 1 and {\bfseries{immediately}} go back to 0. This means that polling the button in {\ttfamily Update}, for example, will never trigger a tap. Either use actions to observe the button or use the {\ttfamily Touch} API from {\ttfamily Enhanced\+Touch} to poll taps.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+active\+Touches} has been removed. Use {\ttfamily Touch.\+active\+Touches} from the new enhanced touch API instead for more reliable touch tracking.
\item {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+all\+Touch\+Controls} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Touchscreen.\+touches}.
\item A new {\ttfamily Enhanced\+Touch} plugin has been added which offers an enhanced {\ttfamily Touch} and {\ttfamily Finger} API to reliably track touches and fingers across updates. This obsoletes the need to manually track touch IDs and phases and gives access to individual touch history.
\item Touch can be simulated from mouse or pen input now. To enable simulation, call {\ttfamily Touch\+Simulation.\+Enable()} or put the {\ttfamily Touch\+Simulation} Mono\+Behaviour in your scene. Also, in the input debugger, you can now enable touch simulation from the "{}\+Options"{} dropdown.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changing state has been decoupled from events. While input events are the primary means by which to trigger state changes, anyone can perform state changes manually now from anywhere. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{InputState.Change(gamepad.leftStick,\ new\ Vector2(123,\ 234));}

\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This change makes it possible to update state {\bfseries{from}} state and thus synthesize input data from other input coming in.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item A new API for recording state changes over time has been added. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{var\ history\ =\ new\ InputStateHistory("{}<Gamepad>/leftStick"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{history.StartRecording();}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{//...}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{foreach\ (var\ record\ in\ history)}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ Debug.Log(record);}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Added support for generic joysticks on Web\+GL (which don\textquotesingle{}t use the standard gamepad mapping).
\item Added support for Dual\+Shock 3 gamepads on desktops.
\item Added support for Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers on desktops.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Actions now also have a {\bfseries{polling API}}!
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+triggered} is true if the action was performed in the current frame.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}()} yields the last value that {\ttfamily started}, {\ttfamily performed}, or {\ttfamily cancelled} (whichever came last) was called with. If the action is disabled, returns {\ttfamily default(\+TValue)}. For {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Type.\+Button} type actions, returns {\ttfamily 1.\+0f} if {\ttfamily triggered==true} and {\ttfamily 0.\+0f} otherwise.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Generated C\# wrappers for .inputactions can now placed relative to the .inputactions file by specifying a path starting with \textquotesingle{}./\textquotesingle{} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily ./foo/bar.cs}).

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{The system no longer supports processing input in {\bfseries{BOTH}} fixed and dynamic updates}}. Instead, a choice has to be made whether to process input before each {\ttfamily Fixed\+Update()} or before each {\ttfamily Update()}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rationale\+: the existing code that supported having both updates receive input independently still had several holes and became increasingly complex and brittle. Our solution was based on not actually processing input twice but on channeling input concurrently into both the state of both updates. Together with the fact that specific inputs have to reset (and possibly accumulate) correctly with respect to their update time slices, this became increasingly hard to do right. This, together with the fact that we\textquotesingle{}ve come to increasingly question the value of this feature, led us to removing the capability while preserving the ability to determine where input is processed.
\item NOTE\+: Timeslicing is NOT affected by this. You can still switch to {\ttfamily Process\+Event\+In\+Fixed\+Updates} and get events timesliced to individual {\ttfamily Fixed\+Update} periods according to their timestamps.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+Update\+Mode.\+Process\+Events\+In\+Both\+Fixed\+And\+Dynamic\+Update} has been removed.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+Update\+Mode.\+Process\+Events\+In\+Dynamic\+Update\+Only} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+Update\+Mode.\+Process\+Events\+In\+Dynamic\+Update} and is now the default.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+Update\+Mode.\+Process\+Events\+In\+Fixed\+Update\+Only} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+Update\+Mode.\+Process\+Events\+In\+Fixed\+Update}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added icons for Player\+Input, Player\+Input\+Manager, Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module and Multiplayer\+Event\+System components.
\item Changed {\ttfamily Keyboard} IME properties ({\ttfamily ime\+Enabled}, {\ttfamily ime\+Cursor\+Position}) to methods ({\ttfamily Set\+IMEEnabled}, {\ttfamily Set\+IMECursor\+Position}).
\item Added getters to all {\ttfamily IInput\+Runtime} properties.
\item Replace some {\ttfamily Get\+Xxx} methods in our API with {\ttfamily xxx} properties.
\item {\ttfamily Pointer.\+phase} has been removed and {\ttfamily Pointer\+Phase} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Touch\+Phase}. Phases are now specific to touch. {\ttfamily Pointer\+Phase\+Control} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Touch\+Phase\+Control}.
\item {\ttfamily Pointer.\+button} has been renamed to {\ttfamily Pointer.\+press} and now is a control that indicates whether the pointer is in "{}press down"{} state.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For mouse, corresponds to left button press.
\item For pen, corresponds to tip contact.
\item For touch, corresponds to primary touch contact (i.\+e. whether {\bfseries{any}} finger is down).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item The state change monitor APIs ({\ttfamily IInput\+State\+Change\+Monitor} and friends) have been moved out of {\ttfamily Input\+System} into a new static class {\ttfamily Input\+State} in {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Experimental.\+Input.\+Low\+Level}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rationale\+: These APIs are fairly low-\/level and not of general interest so having them out of {\ttfamily Input\+System} reduces the API surface visible to most users.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Device\+Change.\+State\+Changed} has been removed and is now a separate callback {\ttfamily Input\+State.\+on\+Change}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rationale\+: The other {\ttfamily Input\+Device\+Change} notifications are low-\/frequency whereas {\ttfamily State\+Changed} is high-\/frequency. Putting them all on the same callback made adding a callback to {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+on\+Device\+Change} unnecessarily expensive.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily IInput\+State\+Callback\+Receiver} has been rewritten from scratch. Now has two simple methods {\ttfamily On\+Next\+Update} and {\ttfamily On\+Event}. If implemented by a device, the device now has completely control over changing its own state. Use the {\ttfamily Input\+State.\+Change} methods to affect state changes while trigger state change monitors (e.\+g. for actions) correctly.
\item Simplified handling of XR input in {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} by having only one set of actions for all XR devices.
\item We now use the same hierarchical device picker in the "{}\+Add Control Scheme"{} popup, which is already used in the "{}\+Input Settings"{} window.
\item Made all {\ttfamily IInput\+State\+Type\+Info} implementations internal, as these did not offer value to the user.
\item Made all {\ttfamily IInput\+Device\+Command\+Info} implementations internal, as these did not offer value to the user.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Read\+Write\+Array}, which was only used for making {\ttfamily Rebinding\+Operation.\+scores} editable, which did not add any value.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Primitive\+Value\+Or\+Array}, as non of it\textquotesingle{}s functionality over {\ttfamily Primitive\+Value} was implemented.
\item Made all {\ttfamily Input\+Processor} implementation internal, as access to these types is exposed only through text mode representations.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Curve\+Processor} as it was not implemented.
\item Renamed XInput\+Controller\+OSX to a more descriptive Xbox\+Gamepad\+Mac\+OS.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+continuous} has been removed. Running logic every frame regardless of input can easily be achieved in game code.
\item The way action behavior is configured has been simplified.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The previous roster of toggles has been replaced with two settings\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\ttfamily Action Type}\+: Determines the behavior of the action. Choices are {\ttfamily Value}, {\ttfamily Button}, and {\ttfamily Pass\+Through}.
\item {\ttfamily Control Type}\+: Determines the type of control (and implicitly the type of value) the action is looking for if the action is a {\ttfamily Value} or {\ttfamily Pass\+Through} action.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The previous {\ttfamily Initial State Check} toggle is now implicit in the action type now. {\ttfamily Value} actions perform an initial state check (i.\+e. trigger if their control is already actuated when the action is enabled). Other types of actions don\textquotesingle{}t.
\item The previous {\ttfamily Pass Through} toggle is now rolled into the action type.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a {\ttfamily Multiplayer\+Event\+System} class, which allows you use multiple UI event systems to control different parts of the UI by different players.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} now lets you specify an {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset} in the {\ttfamily actions\+Asset} property. If this is set, the inspector will populate all actions from this asset. If you have a {\ttfamily Player\+Input} component on the same game object, referencing the same {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset}, the {\ttfamily Player\+Input} component will keep the actions on the {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} in synch, allowing easy setup of multiplayer UI systems.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Stick\+Control.\+x} and {\ttfamily Stick\+Control.\+y} are now deadzoned, i.\+e. have {\ttfamily Axis\+Deadzone} processors on them. This affects all gamepads and joysticks.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{NOTE\+:}} The deadzoning is {\bfseries{independent}} of the stick. Whereas the stack has a radial deadzones, {\ttfamily x} and {\ttfamily y} have linear deadzones. This means that {\ttfamily left\+Stick.\+Read\+Value().x} is {\bfseries{not}} necessary equal to {\ttfamily left\+Stick.\+x.\+Read\+Value()}.
\item This change also fixes the problem of noise from sticks not getting filtered out and causing devices such as the PS4 controller to constantly make itself {\ttfamily Gamepad.\+current}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Redesigned {\ttfamily UIAction\+Input\+Module}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a button in the inspector to automatically assign actions from an input action asset based on commonly used action names.
\item Will now populate actions with useful defaults.
\item Removed {\ttfamily click\+Speed} property -\/ will use native click counts from the OS where available instead.
\item Removed {\ttfamily send\+Events\+When\+In\+Background} property.
\item Hiding {\ttfamily Touches} and {\ttfamily Tracked\+Devices} until we decide how to handle them.
\item Remove {\ttfamily move\+Deadzone} property as it is made redundant by the action\textquotesingle{}s dead zone.
\item Removed {\ttfamily UIAction\+Input\+Module\+Enabler} component, {\ttfamily UIAction\+Input\+Module} will now enable itself.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Changed default button press point to 0.\+5.
\item Changed all constants in public API to match \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} naming conventions ("{}\+Constant"{} instead of "{}k\+Constant"{}).
\item Changed namespace from {\ttfamily Unity\+Engine.\+Experimental.\+Input} to {\ttfamily \doxylink{namespace_unity_engine_1_1_input_system}{Unity\+Engine.\+Input\+System}}.
\item Generated wrapper code now has nicer formatting.
\item Renamed {\ttfamily UIAction\+Input\+Module} to {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module}.
\item Nicer icons for {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Assets} and {\ttfamily Input\+Actions} and for {\ttfamily Button} and generic controls.
\item Change all public API using {\ttfamily Int\+Ptr} to use unsafe pointer types instead.
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input} will no longer disable any actions not in the currently active action map when disabling input or switching action maps.
\item Change some public fields into properties.
\item Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} project settings are now called "{}\+Input System Package"{} in the project window instead of "{}\+Input (\+NEW)"{}.
\item Removed {\ttfamily Plugins} from all namespaces.
\item Rename "{}\+Cancelled"{} -\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} "{}\+Canceled"{} (US spelling) in all APIs.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Adding devices to "{}\+Supported Devices"{} in input preferences not allowing to select certain device types (like "{}\+Gamepad"{}).
\item Fixed scrolling in {\ttfamily UIAction\+Input\+Module}.
\item Fixed compiling the input system package in \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} 19.\+2 with ugui being moved to a package now.
\item In the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} project settings window, you can no longer add a supported device twice.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Custom inspector for {\ttfamily Player\+Input} no longer adds duplicates of action events if {\ttfamily Invoke \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Events} notification behavior is selected.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Hold} interactions firing immediately before the duration has passed.
\item Fixed editing bindings or processors for {\ttfamily Input\+Action} fields in the inspector (Changes wouldn\textquotesingle{}t persist before).
\item Fixed exception message when calling {\ttfamily Callback\+Context.\+Read\+Value\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}()} for an action with a composite binding with {\ttfamily TValue} not matching the composite\textquotesingle{}s value type.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Joystick.\+axes} and {\ttfamily Joystick.\+buttons} have been removed.
\item Generated wrapper code for Input Action Assets are now self-\/contained, generating all the data from code and not needing a reference to the asset; {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Asset\+Reference} has been removed.
\item The option to generate interfaces on wrappers has been removed, instead we always do this now.
\item The option to generate events on wrappers has been removed, we felt that this no longer made sense.
\item Will now show default values in Input Action inspector if no custom values for file path, class name or namespace have been provided.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+run\+In\+Background} has been removed. This should now be supported or not on a per-\/device level. Most devices never supported it in the first place, so a global setting did not seem to be useful.
\item Several new {\ttfamily Sensor}-\/based classes have been added. Various existing Android sensor implementations are now based on them.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Layout\+Attribute} is no longer inherited.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rationale\+: A class marked as a layout will usually be registered using {\ttfamily Register\+Layout}. A class derived from it will usually be registered the same way. Because of layout inheritance, properties applied to the base class through {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Layout\+Attribute} will affect the subclass as intended. Not inheriting the attribute itself, however, now allows having properties such as {\ttfamily is\+Generic\+Type\+Of\+Device} which should not be inherited.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily acceleration}, {\ttfamily orientation}, and {\ttfamily angular\+Velocity} controls from {\ttfamily Dual\+Shock\+Gamepad} base class.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item They are still on {\ttfamily Dual\+Shock\+Gamepad\+PS4}.
\item The reason is that ATM we do not yet support these controls other than on the PS4. The previous setup pretended that these controls work when in fact they don\textquotesingle{}t.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Marking a control as noisy now also marks all child controls as noisy.
\item The input system now defaults to ignoring any HID devices with usage types not known to map to game controllers. You can use {\ttfamily HIDSupport.\+supported\+Usages} to enable specific usage types.
\item In the Input Settings window, asset selection has now been moved to the "{}gear"{} popup menu. If no asset is created, we now automatically create one.
\item In the inspector for Input Settings assets, we now show a button to go to the Input Settings window, and a button to make the asset active if it isn\textquotesingle{}t.
\item \doxylink{namespace_tests}{Tests} are now no longer part of the com.\+unity.\+inputsystem package. The {\ttfamily Input\+Test\+Fixture} class still is for when you want to write input-\/related tests for your project. You can reference the {\ttfamily Unity.\+Input\+System.\+Test\+Fixture} assembly when you need to do that.
\item Implemented adding usages to and removing them from devices.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A number of changes have been made to the control picker UI in the editor. \textbackslash{} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The button to pick controls interactively (e.\+g. by pressing a button on a gamepad) has been moved inside the picker and renamed to "{}\+Listen"{}. It now works as a toggle that puts the picker into a special kind of \textquotesingle{}search\textquotesingle{} mode. While listening, suitable controls that are actuated will be listed in the picker and can then be picked from.
\item Controls are now displayed with their nice names (e.\+g. "{}\+Cross"{} instead of "{}button\+South"{} in the case of the PS4 controller).
\item Child controls are indented instead of listed in "{}parent/child"{} format.
\item The hierarchy of devices has been rearranged for clarity. The toplevel groups of "{}\+Specific Devices"{} and "{}\+Abstract Devices"{} are now merged into one hierarchy that progressively groups devices into more specific groups.
\item Controls now have icons displayed for them.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item There is new support for binding to keys on the keyboard by their generated character rather than by their location. \textbackslash{} 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item At the toplevel of the Keyboard device, you now have the choice of either binding by keyboard location or binding by generated/mapped character.
\item Binding by location shows differences between the local keyboard layout and the US reference layout.
\item The control path language has been extended to allow referencing controls by display name. {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Keyboard\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/\#(a)} binds to the control on a {\ttfamily Keyboard} with the display name {\ttfamily a}.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily continuous} flag is now ignored for {\ttfamily Press and Release} interactions, as it did not make sense.
\item Reacting to controls that are already actuated when an action is enabled is now an {\bfseries{optional}} behavior rather than the default behavior. This is a {\bfseries{breaking}} change.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Essentially, this change reverts back to the behavior before 0.\+2-\/preview.
\item To reenable the behavior, toggle "{}\+Initial State Check"{} on in the UI or set the {\ttfamily initial\+State\+Check} property in code. 
\item The reason for the change is that having the behavior on by default made certain setups hard to achieve. For example, if {\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}Keyboard\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}/escape} is used in one action map to toggle {\itshape into} the main menu and in another action map to toggle {\itshape out} of it, then the previous behavior would immediately exit out of the menu if {\ttfamily escape} was still pressed from going into the menu. \textbackslash{} We have come to believe that wanting to react to the current state of a control right away is the less often desirable behavior and so have made it optional with a separate toggle.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Processors and Interactions are now shown in a component-\/inspector-\/like fashion in the Input Action editor window, allowing you to see the properties of all items at once.
\item The various {\ttfamily Input\+Action.\+last\+Trigger\+XXX} APIs have been removed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rationale\+: They have very limited usefulness and if you need the information, it\textquotesingle{}s easy to set things up in order to keep track of it yourself. Also, we plan on having a polling API for actions in the future which is really what the {\ttfamily last\+Action\+XXX} APIs were trying to (imperfectly) solve.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Tap}, {\ttfamily Slow\+Tap}, and {\ttfamily Multi\+Tap} interactions now respect button press points.
\item {\ttfamily Tap}, {\ttfamily Slow\+Tap}, and {\ttfamily Multi\+Tap} interactions now have improved parameter editing UIs.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Input Settings configured in the editor are now transferred to the built player correctly.
\item Time slicing for fixed updates now works correctly, even when pausing or dropping frames.
\item Make sure we Disable any Input\+Action\+Asset when it is being destroyed. Otherwise, callbacks which were not cleaned up would could cause exceptions.
\item Dual\+Shock sensors on PS4 are now marked as noisy (\#494).
\item IL2\+CPP causing issues with XInput on windows and osx desktops.
\item Devices not being available yet in {\ttfamily Mono\+Behavior.\+Awake}, {\ttfamily Mono\+Behaviour.\+Start}, and {\ttfamily Mono\+Behaviour.\+On\+Enable} in player or when entering play mode in editor.
\item Fixed a bug where the event buffer used by {\ttfamily Input\+Event\+Trace} could get corrupted.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Actions and bindings disappearing when control schemes have spaces in their names.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Rebinding\+Exceptions.\+Rebind\+Operation} can now be reused as intended; used to stop working properly the first time a rebind completed or was cancelled.
\item Actions bound to multiple controls now trigger correctly when using {\ttfamily Press\+Interaction} set to {\ttfamily Release\+Only} (\#492).
\item {\ttfamily Player\+Input} no longer fails to find actions when using Unity\+Events (\#500).
\item The {\ttfamily "{}\{...\}"{}} format for referencing action maps and actions using GUIDs as strings has been obsoleted. It will still work but adding the extra braces is no longer necessary.
\item Drag\&dropping bindings between other bindings that came before them in the list no longer drops the items at a location one higher up in the list than intended.
\item Editing name of control scheme in editor not taking effect {\itshape except} if hitting enter key.
\item Saving no longer causes the selection of the current processor or interaction to be lost.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This was especially annoying when having "{}\+Auto-\/\+Save"{} on as it made editing parameters on interactions and processors very tedious.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item In locales that use decimal separators other than \textquotesingle{}.\textquotesingle{}, floating-\/point parameters on composites, interactions, and processors no longer lead to invalid serialized data being generated.
\item Fix choosing "{}\+Add Action"{} in action map context menu throwing an exception.

\item Fixed pasting or dragging a composite binding from one action into another.
\item In the action map editor window, switching from renaming an action to renaming an action map will no longer break the UI.
\item Fixed calling Enable/\+Disable from within action callbacks sometimes leading to corruption of state which would then lead to actions not getting triggered (\#472).
\item Fixed setting of "{}\+Auto-\/\+Save"{} toggle in action editor getting lost on domain reload.
\item Fixed blurry icons in editor for imported .inputactions assets and actions in them.

\item Added ability to change which part of a composite a binding that is part of the composite is assigned to.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bindings have GUIDs now like actions and maps already did. This allows to persistently and uniquely identify individual bindings.
\item Replaced UI overlay while rebinding interactively with cancellable progress bar. Interactive rebinding now cancels automatically after 4 seconds without suitable input.
\item Bindings that are not assigned to any control scheme are now visible when a particular control scheme is selected.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bindings not assigned to any control scheme are active in {\itshape ALL} control schemes.
\item The change makes this visible in the UI now.
\item When a specific control scheme is selected, these bindings are affixed with {\ttfamily \{GLOBAL\}} for added visibility.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item When filtering by devices from a control scheme, the filtering now takes layout inheritance into account. So, a binding to a control on {\ttfamily Pointer} will now be shown when the filter is {\ttfamily Mouse}.
\item The public control picker API has been revised.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The simplest way to add control picker UI to a control path is to add an {\ttfamily Input\+Control\+Attribute} to the field.

\item Sort events in input debugger window by id rather then by timestamp.
\item Make parsing of float parameters support floats represented in "{}e"{}-\/notation and "{}\+Infinity"{}.
\item Input device icons in input debugger window now render in appropriate resolution on retina displays.

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}NOTE\+: There are some breaking changes.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} 2018.\+2 support code.
\item Removed .NET 3.\+5 support code.
\item Started using C\# 7.
\item {\ttfamily IInput\+Control\+Processor\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} has been replaced with {\ttfamily Input\+Processor} and {\ttfamily Input\+Processor\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} base classes.
\item {\ttfamily IInput\+Binding\+Composite} has been replaced with an {\ttfamily Input\+Binding\+Composite} base class and the {\ttfamily IInput\+Binding\+Composite\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} interface has been merged with the {\ttfamily Input\+Binding\+Composite\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TValue\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} class which had already existed.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+User.\+on\+Unpaired\+Device\+User} will now notify for each actuated control until the device is paired or there are no more actuated controls.
\item {\ttfamily Sensitivity\+Processor} has been removed.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The approach needs rethinking. What {\ttfamily Sensitivity\+Processor} did caused more problems than it solved.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item State monitors no longer have their timeouts removed automatically when they fire. This makes it possible to have a timeout that is removed only in response to a specific state change.
\item Events for devices that implement {\ttfamily IInput\+State\+Callbacks} (such as {\ttfamily Touchscreen}) are allowed to go back in time. Avoids the problem of having to order events between multiple fingers correctly or seeing events getting rejected.
\item {\ttfamily Pen\+State.\+Button} is now {\ttfamily Pen\+Button}.
\item Removed Touch\+Position\+Transform\+Processor, was used only by Android, the position transformation will occur in native backend in 2019.\+x

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bindings that have no interactions on them will trigger differently now. {\bfseries{This is a breaking change}}.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Previously, these bindings would trigger {\ttfamily performed} on every value change including when going back to their default value. This is why you would see two calls of {\ttfamily performed} with a button; one when the button was pressed, another when it was depressed.
\item Now, a binding without an interaction will trigger {\ttfamily started} and then {\ttfamily performed} when a bound control is actuated. Thereafter, the action will remain in {\ttfamily Started} phase. For as long as the control is actuated, every value change will trigger {\ttfamily performed} again. When the control stops being actuated, it will trigger {\ttfamily cancelled} and the action will remain in {\ttfamily Waiting} state.
\item Control actuation is defined as a control having a magnitude (see {\ttfamily Input\+Control.\+Evaluate\+Magnitude}) greater than zero. If a control does not support magnitudes (returns -\/1 from {\ttfamily Evaluate\+Magnitude}), then the control is considered actuated when it changes state away from its default state.
\item To restore the previous behavior, simply change code like 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAction.performed\ +=\ MyCallback;}

\end{DoxyCode}
 to 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAction.performed\ +=\ MyCallback;}
\DoxyCodeLine{myAction.cancelled\ +=\ MyCallback;}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Alternatively, enable {\ttfamily pass\+Through} mode on an action. This effectively restores the previous default behavior of actions. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ -\/\ \`{}PressAndReleaseInteraction`:\ Can\ simply\ be\ removed\ from\ bindings.\ The\ default\ behavior\ with\ no\ interaction\ encompasses\ press\ and\ release\ detection.\ Use\ \`{}started`\ to\ know\ then\ a\ button\ is\ pressed\ and\ \`{}cancelled`\ to\ know\ when\ it\ is\ released.\ To\ set\ a\ custom\ button\ press\ point,\ simply\ put\ an\ \`{}AxisDeadzoneProcessor`\ on\ the\ binding.}

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ -\/\ Also,\ the\ interaction\ now\ operates\ on\ control\ actuation\ rather\ than\ reading\ out\ float\ values\ directly.\ This\ means\ that\ any\ control\ that\ supports\ magnitudes\ can\ be\ used.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ -\/\ Also\ supports\ continuous\ mode\ now.}
\DoxyCodeLine{-\/\ If\ bound\ controls\ are\ already\ actuated\ when\ an\ action\ is\ enabled,\ the\ action\ will\ now\ trigger\ in\ the\ next\ input\ update\ as\ if\ the\ control\ had\ just\ been\ moved\ from\ non-\/actuated\ to\ actuated\ state.}

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ -\/\ When\ ambiguity\ is\ detected,\ the\ greatest\ amount\ of\ actuation\ on\ any\ of\ the\ controls\ gets\ to\ drive\ the\ action.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ -\/\ In\ practice,\ this\ means\ that\ as\ long\ as\ any\ of\ the\ controls\ bound\ to\ an\ action\ is\ actuated,\ the\ action\ will\ keep\ going.\ This\ resolves\ ambiguities\ when\ an\ action\ has\ primary\ and\ secondary\ bindings,\ for\ examples,\ or\ when\ an\ action\ is\ bound\ to\ multiple\ different\ devices\ at\ the\ same\ time.}

\item "{}\+C\# Class File"{} property on .inputactions importer settings now has a file picker next to it.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Trace} has seen various improvements.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Recorded data will now stay valid even if actions are rebound to different controls.
\item Can listen to all actions using {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Trace.\+Subscribe\+To\+All}.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Action\+Trace} now maintains a list of subscriptions. Add subscriptions with {\ttfamily Subscribe\+To} and remove a subscription with {\ttfamily Unsubscribe\+From}. See the \href{Documentation~/Actions.md\#tracing-actions}{\texttt{ documentation}} for details.

\item Fixed support for \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} 2019.\+1 where we landed a native API change.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+User.\+Unpair\+Devices\+And\+Remove\+User()} corrupting device pairings of other Input\+Users
\item Control picker in UI having no devices if list of supported devices is empty but not null
\item {\ttfamily Index\+Out\+Of\+Range\+Exception} when having multiple action maps in an asset (\#359 and \#358).
\item Interactions timing out even if there was a pending event that would complete the interaction in time.
\item Action editor updates when asset is renamed or moved.
\item Exceptions when removing action in last position of action map.
\item Devices marked as unsupported in input settings getting added back on domain reload.
\item Fixed {\ttfamily Pen} causing exceptions and asserts.
\item Composites that assign multiple bindings to parts failing to set up properly when parts are assigned out of order (\#410).

\begin{DoxyVerb}NOTE: The minimum version requirement for the new input system has been bumped
      to 2018.3. The previous minum requirement of 2018.2 is no longer supported.
      Also, we have dropped support for the .NET 3.5 runtime. The new .NET 4
      runtime is now required to use the new input system.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Configuration} has been replaced with a new {\ttfamily Input\+Settings} class.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+Configuration.\+lock\+Input\+To\+Game} has been moved to {\ttfamily Input\+Editor\+User\+Settings.\+lock\+Input\+To\+Game\+View}. This setting is now persisted as a local user setting.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+update\+Mask} has been replaced with {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+update\+Mode}.
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+run\+In\+Background} has been moved to {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+run\+In\+Background}.
\item Icons have been updated for improved styling and now have separate dark and light skin versions.
\item {\ttfamily Lock Input To Game} and {\ttfamily Diagnostics Mode} are now persisted as user settings
\item Brought back {\ttfamily .current} getters and added {\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+filter\+Noise\+On\+Current} to control whether noise filtering on the getters is performed or not.
\item Removed old and outdated Doxygen-\/generated API docs.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+settings} contains the current input system settings.
\item A new UI has been added to "{}\+Edit $>$$>$ Project Settings..."{} to edit input system settings. Settings are stored in a user-\/controlled asset in any location inside {\ttfamily Assets/}. Multiple assets can be used and switched between.
\item Joystick HIDs are now supported on Windows, Mac, and UWP.
\item Can now put system into manual update mode ({\ttfamily Input\+Settings.\+update\+Mode}). In this mode, events will not get automatically processed. To process events, call {\ttfamily Input\+System.\+Update()}.
\item Added shortcuts to action editor window (requires 2019.\+1).
\item Added icons for .inputactions assets.
