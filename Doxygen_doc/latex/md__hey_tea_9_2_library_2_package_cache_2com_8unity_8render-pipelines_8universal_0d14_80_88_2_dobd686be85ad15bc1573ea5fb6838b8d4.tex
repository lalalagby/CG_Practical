 In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), you can work with multiple Cameras to\+:

Camera Stacking allows you to create effects such as 3D models in a 2D UI, or the cockpit of a vehicle.

You can combine these ways of working for more complex effects. For example, you can define two Camera Stacks, and then set each of those to Camera Stacks that render to a different area of the same render target.
