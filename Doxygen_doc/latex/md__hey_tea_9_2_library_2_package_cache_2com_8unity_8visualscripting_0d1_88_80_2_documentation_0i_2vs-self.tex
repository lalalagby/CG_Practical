 Use a This node to return a Game\+Object with a Script Machine component that has the Script Graph. If the Script Machine uses an {\bfseries{Graph}} source and multiple Game\+Objects use the same graph, the returned Game\+Object can change. ~\newline


Many nodes default their target to {\bfseries{This}}. For example, the following Transform nodes are the same\+:



Not all nodes support the {\bfseries{This}} inline value. Any node that doesn\textquotesingle{}t support the {\bfseries{This}} inline value displays {\bfseries{None}} instead of {\bfseries{This}} in the default value field. For example, the Destroy node displays {\bfseries{None}}.

In these cases, manually specify the connection if you want to use {\bfseries{This}}.



You can use the This node in a graph even if the graph isn\textquotesingle{}t yet assigned to a Game\+Object. The This node represents the Game\+Object that owns the graph at runtime.
