An add-\/on module for \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Virtual Camera that tweaks the orthographic size of the virtual camera. It detects the presence of the Pixel Perfect Camera component and use the settings from that Pixel Perfect Camera to correct the orthographic size so that pixel art sprites would appear pixel perfect when the virtual camera becomes live.
