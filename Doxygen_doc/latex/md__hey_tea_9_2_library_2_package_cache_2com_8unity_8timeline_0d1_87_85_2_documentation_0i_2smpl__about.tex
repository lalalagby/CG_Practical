This sample demonstrates how \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} can be used to create a small in-\/game moment, using built-\/in tracks.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4688}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Overview}{Overview}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4688}
In this example, we have a {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}} character jogging and then colliding with another character. The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}} character represents our gameplay character and is using a looping jog animation. The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} then takes control of the player character, collides with the other character, then returns to his original gameplay animation (jog) once the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} has finished. Note that the gameplay animation is driven by an Animator and will only play at runtime. The character will be in a T-\/\+Stance pose for the runtime portion when using the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} preview.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4689}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Timeline Structure}{Timeline Structure}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4689}
This sample uses the following tracks\+: Activation, Animation, Audio, Control and Marker track. The {\ttfamily Gameplay\+Sequence} timeline has been organized in the following groups\+: {\ttfamily Building}, {\ttfamily Lights}, {\ttfamily Cameras}, {\ttfamily Characters}, {\ttfamily Audio} and {\ttfamily Props}.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4690}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Building group}}{{\itshape Building group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4690}
This group contains two Control tracks\+: {\ttfamily Building Spawn} which spawns the building prefab, and {\ttfamily Building Particles} that controls two particle systems in the scene ({\ttfamily Electrical\+Sparks} and {\ttfamily Sand\+Swirls\+Effect}).\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4691}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Lights group}}{{\itshape Lights group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4691}
This group contains two Animation tracks; one for the Sun light, and the other for the flickering light. Both tracks where animated in \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} and the curves can be seen by enabling the curves icon or double clicking on the track to open the Animation window. {\ttfamily Sun light} is animated in Rotation (sunrise) and the {\ttfamily Point light} has a spiked {\ttfamily Intensity} curve.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4692}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Cameras group}}{{\itshape Cameras group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4692}
This group contains two cameras\+: {\ttfamily Main camera} using an Animation track, and {\ttfamily Follow camera} using an Activation track. {\ttfamily Main Camera} has an animation curve for the continuous movement (which can be seen by enabling the curves icon) and two override tracks, one for each character. The clips on the override tracks have static values for a fixed camera shot. {\ttfamily Follow camera} is simply parented child of the \doxylink{class_player}{Player} character\textquotesingle{}s root and activated for the follow-\/cam shots.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4693}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Characters group}}{{\itshape Characters group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4693}
The first track is an Animation track for the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}}character. Notice that clip pre and post extrapolations are set to {\ttfamily None}, meaning the character will not be influenced by the timeline during these gaps. At runtime, these gaps mean the {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}} character will be using his Animator state, jog. The second track is an Activation track for the second character, making his appear in the scene. The third and last track is an Animation track for the second character. On this track, the second character blends from one clip to another creating a cinematic sequence.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4694}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Audio group}}{{\itshape Audio group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4694}
This group contains four Audio tracks; {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}}, {\ttfamily crickets}, {\ttfamily neon-\/light} \& {\ttfamily character2}. The {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}} track has a jog/breathing and bump clip. The {\ttfamily crickets} track has pan and volume animation curves (can be seen by enabling the curves icon). The {\ttfamily neon-\/light} sound is for the flickering {\ttfamily Point} light. The {\ttfamily Character2} tracks contains all audio clips for this second character.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4695}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\itshape Props group}}{{\itshape Props group}}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4695}
This group animates {\ttfamily Table} and {\ttfamily Can}. The first Activation track makes {\ttfamily Table} appear in the scene. The second Activation track makes a static version of {\ttfamily Can} appear in the scene. The third track is an Animation track that animates the table bump animation. The last track is a Control track with a sub-\/timeline for the can animation. The static version of the can is disabled and replaced with the animated version when the Control clip starts. Double-\/clicking the Control track clip will enter the {\ttfamily Can} sub-\/timeline.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4696}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily Can} Sub-\/\+Timeline}{{\ttfamily Can} Sub-\/\+Timeline}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4696}
This sub-\/timeline contains an Animation track for the can rolling off the table and bouncing on the ground, an Audio track for the sounds effects and a Control track for the liquid particles splashing out of the can.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4697}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Marker track}{Marker track}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4697}
In the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window, under the time ruler, there is a Marker track with one Signal at frame 1200. This is the Signal marker that triggers the jog audio clip on {\ttfamily \doxylink{class_player}{Player}} once the timeline finishes the gameplay jog.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4698}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Customization samples}{Customization samples}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2smpl__about_autotoc_md4698}


This sample includes tracks, clips, markers and actions that demonstrate how to extend and customize timeline in different ways.
