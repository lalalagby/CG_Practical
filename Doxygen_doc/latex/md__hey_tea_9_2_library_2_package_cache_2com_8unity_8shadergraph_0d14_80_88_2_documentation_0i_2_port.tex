A {\bfseries{Port}} defines an input or output on a \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_node}{Node}{0}. Connecting \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_edge}{Edges}{0} to a {\bfseries{Port}} allows data to flow through the Shader Graph node network.

Each {\bfseries{Port}} has a \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_data-_types}{Data Type}{0} which defines what edges can be connected to it. Each data type has an associated color for identifying its type.

Only one edge can be connected to any input {\bfseries{Port}} but multiple edges can be connected to an output {\bfseries{Port}}.

You can open a contextual \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_create-_node-_menu}{Create Node Menu}{0} by dragging an edge from a {\bfseries{Port}} with left mouse button and releasing it in an empty area of the workspace.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_port_autotoc_md3601}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Default Inputs}{Default Inputs}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_port_autotoc_md3601}
Each {\bfseries{Input Port}}, a {\bfseries{Port}} on the left side of a node implying that it is for inputting data into the node, has a {\bfseries{Default Input}}. This appears as a small field connected to the {\bfseries{Port}} when there is no edge connected. This field will display an input for the ports data type unless the {\bfseries{Port}} has a \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8shadergraph_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2_port-_bindings}{Port Binding}{0}. If a {\bfseries{Port}} does have a port binding the default input field might display a special field, such as a dropdown for selecting UV channels, or just a label to help you understand the intended input, such as coordinate space labels for geometry data.
