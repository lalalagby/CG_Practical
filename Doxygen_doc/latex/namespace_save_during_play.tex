\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Using reflection, this class scans a Game\+Object (and optionally its children) and records all the field settings. This only works for "{}nice"{} field settings within Mono\+Behaviours. Changes to the behaviour stack made between saving and restoring will fool this class. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class {\bfseries Object\+Tree\+Util}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A collection of tools for finding objects. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_save_during_play_1_1_save_during_play}{Save\+During\+Play}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em For all registered object types, record their state when exiting Play Mode, and restore that state to the objects in the scene. This is a very limited implementation which has not been rigorously tested with many objects types. It\textquotesingle{}s quite possible that not everything will be saved. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
