 \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} supports nesting \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances. A nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance refers to a \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance that is added within another \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. The {\bfseries{master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance}} refers to the main or parent \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance that includes other \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances.

Nesting \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances is useful if you have a large team working on different aspects of a Project and you want them to collaborate on the same cinematic or cut-\/scene.

For example, you are developing a puzzle game that starts with a cinematic of the character walking into frame while the pieces on the game board move into position. You could create a master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance for the character walking into frame. You could create another \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance for the game board animation. You could then nest the game board animation into the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance of the character walking into frame.



{\itshape The master Nest\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance has a character walking and theme music. A Control track nests the Board\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance for the game board animation.}

By creating a master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance with nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances, different teams can work on different animations and then combine the animations into one master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}. In the puzzle game example, one team could work on the character \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance, and another team could work on the game board animation.

When you have two \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances, and you want to nest one instance into the other, open the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance that you want to be the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. To ensure that the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window does not switch while you select Game\+Objects, click the lock icon (red arrow)\+:



{\itshape The master Nest\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance has a character walking and theme music.}

Find the Game\+Object in your Scene that is associated with the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance that you want to nest inside the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. Drag the Game\+Object into the Clips view of the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window.



{\itshape The Board Game\+Object is associated with the Board\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. Drag the Board Game\+Object into the Nest\+TL master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} to nest the Board\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance in the Nest\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance.}

The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window creates a Control track and places the Control clip where you drop the Game\+Object. The Control clip is set to the same size as the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. When a Control clip contains a nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance, a downward arrow appears beside its name. To edit a nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance from the master timeline, double-\/click its Control clip.



{\itshape Double-\/click the Control clip to edit the nested Board\+TL \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance from within the master}

A warning icon appears beside the name of the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance because the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead is outside the range of the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}. \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} also disables the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead controls.

When you edit a nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance, you cannot change the duration of the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. You must return to the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance and change the duration of the Control clip to change the duration of the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance. To return to the master, click the name of the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance (red arrow)\+:



{\itshape Warning icon (red circle) means the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead Controls are disabled.}

The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window is in this state because, by default, the size of the Control clip in the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance determines when the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance is active. Use one of the following methods to change this state and edit the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Click the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} ruler to move the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead into the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}. This enables editing and the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playback Controls.
\item In the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance, move the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead to within the Control clip before you double-\/click the Control clip.
\item In the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance, select the Control clip, and disable the Control Activation property in the Inspector window.
\end{DoxyItemize}



{\itshape Disable the Control Activation property (red outline) to have the nested \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance active throughout the duration of the master \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance.}
