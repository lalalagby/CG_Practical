 A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality to scroll over this content.

Usually a Scroll Rect is combined with a \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_mask}{Mask}{0} in order to create a scroll view, where only the scrollable content inside the Scroll Rect is visible. It can also additionally be combined with one or two \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scrollbar}{Scrollbars}{0} that can be dragged to scroll horizontally or vertically.

The important elements in a scroll view are the {\bfseries{viewport}}, the scrolling {\bfseries{content}}, and optionally one or two {\bfseries{scrollbars}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The root Game\+Object has the Scroll Rect component.
\item The viewport has a \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_mask}{Mask}{0} component. The viewport can either be the root Game\+Object, or a separate Game\+Object that\textquotesingle{}s a child to the root. If auto-\/hiding scrollbars are used, it must be a child. The viewport Rect Transform needs to be referenced in the {\bfseries{Viewport}} property of the Scroll Rect.
\item All the scrolling content must be children of a single content Game\+Object that is a child to the viewport. The content Rect Transform needs to be referenced in the {\bfseries{Content}} property of the Scroll Rect.
\item The scrollbars -\/ if used -\/ are children to the root Game\+Object. See the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scrollbar}{Scrollbar}{0} page for more details on the setup of a scrollbar and see the section {\bfseries{Scrollbar setup}} below for information about setup of scrollbars with a scroll view.
\end{DoxyItemize}

This image shows a setup where the viewport is a child to the scroll view root. This is the default used when using the Game\+Object \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} UI \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Scroll View menu option.



To scroll content, the input must be received from inside the bounds of the Scroll\+Rect, not on the content itself.

Take care when using Unrestricted scrolling movement as it is possible to lose control of the content in an irretrievable way. When using Elastic or Constrained movement it is best to position the content so that it starts within the bounds of the Scroll\+Rect, or undesirable behaviour may occur as the Rect\+Transform tries to bring the content back within its bounds.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scroll_rect_autotoc_md4917}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Scrollbar setup}{Scrollbar setup}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scroll_rect_autotoc_md4917}
Optionally, the Scroll Rect can be linked to a horizontal and/or a vertical {\bfseries{Scrollbar}}. These are typically placed in the hierarchy as siblings to the viewport, and when present, should be dragged into the {\bfseries{Horizontal Scrollbar}} and {\bfseries{Vertical Scrollbar}} properties of the Scroll Rect, respectively. Note that the {\bfseries{Direction}} property on such a horizontal Scrollbar should be set to {\bfseries{Left To Right}}, and on the vertical Scrollbar to {\bfseries{Bottom To Top}}.

The scrollbars can optionally have auto-\/hiding behaviour that hides the scrollbars if the content doesn\textquotesingle{}t need to scroll because it isn\textquotesingle{}t larger than the viewport. Note that the auto-\/hiding only ever happens in Play Mode. In Edit Mode the scrollbars are always shown. This prevents marking the scene as dirty when it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t be, and also help authoring content with proportions that there\textquotesingle{}s room for even when the scrollbars are shown.

If one or both scrollbars have their visibility behaviour set to {\bfseries{Auto Hide And Expand View}}, the viewport is automatically expanded when the scrollbars are hidden in order to take up the extra room where the scrollbars would otherwise have been. With this setup, the position and size of the {\bfseries{view}} is driven by the Scroll Rect, and the width of the {\bfseries{horizontal scrollbar}} as well as the height of the {\bfseries{vertical scrollbar}} is driven as well. With this setup the viewport as well as the scrollbars must be children to the Scroll Rect root Game\+Object.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scroll_rect_autotoc_md4918}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Hints}{Hints}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2script-_scroll_rect_autotoc_md4918}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The pivot and anchors of the content Rect\+Transform can be used to determine how the content is aligned inside the scroll view if the content grows or shrinks. If the content should stay aligned with the top, set the anchors to the top of the parent, and set the pivot to the top position.
\item See the page \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8ugui_0d1_80_80_2_documentation_0i_2_h_o_w_t_o-_u_i_fit_content_size}{Making UI elements fit the size of their content}{0} for information about how to make the content Rect Transform automatically resize to fit the content.
