Vector3 {\bfseries tangent}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Offset from the position, which defines the tangent of the curve at the waypoint. ~\newline
 The length of the tangent encodes the strength of the bezier handle. ~\newline
 The same handle is used symmetrically on both sides of the waypoint, to ensure smoothness. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item

float {\bfseries roll}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Defines the roll of the path at this waypoint. ~\newline
 The other orientation axes are inferred from the tangent and world up. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
