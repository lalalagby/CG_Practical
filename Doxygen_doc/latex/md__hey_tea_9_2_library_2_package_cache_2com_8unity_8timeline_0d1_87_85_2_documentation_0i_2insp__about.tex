 The Inspector window displays information about the selected Game\+Object including all attached components and their properties. This section documents the properties in the Inspector window that appear when you select one or many \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Assets, tracks, clips, or a combination.

If you select a single \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset, track, or clip, the Inspector window displays the properties for the selected Asset, track, or clip. For example, if you select an Animation clip, the Inspector window shows the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2insp__clp__anim__com}{common properties}{0} and \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2insp__clp__anim__plyb}{Playable Asset properties}{0} for the selected Animation clip.

If you select multiple \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Assets, tracks, or clips, the Inspector window shows two sections\+: a section with properties that apply to the entire selection, and a section of common properties that apply to each selected object individually.

For example, if you select an Audio clip on one track and two Animation clips on another track, the Inspector window includes {\bfseries{Multiple Clip Timing}} properties and {\bfseries{Clip Timing}} properties\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use the {\bfseries{Multiple Clip Timing}} properties to change the {\bfseries{Start}} or {\bfseries{End}} of the selection as a group. For example, if you change the {\bfseries{Start}} to frame 30, the selection of clips start at frame 30. This moves the start of the first clip to frame 30 and the remaining selected clips are placed relative to the first clip, respecting gaps between selected clips.
\item Use the {\bfseries{Clip Timing}} properties to change the common properties for each selected clip. If the selected clips have different values for the same property, the value is represented with a dash ("{}-\/"{}). If you change the dash to a value, it sets the value for all selected clips. For example, if you change the {\bfseries{Ease In Duration}} from a dash to 10 frames, the ease in of each selected clip changes to 10 frames.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If your selection does not have common properties, the Inspector window prompts you to narrow the selection. For example, if you select an Animation track and an Audio clip in the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window, you are prompted to narrow the selection\+:
