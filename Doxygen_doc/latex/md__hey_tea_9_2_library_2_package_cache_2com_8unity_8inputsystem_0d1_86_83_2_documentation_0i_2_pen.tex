 Pen support comprises both tablets on desktops (such as the various tablets produced by Wacom), and styluses on mobile devices (such as the stylus on the Samsung Note, the Apple Pencil on i\+OS, or the Surface Pen on the \doxylink{namespace_microsoft}{Microsoft} Surface line of notebooks).

Pens generally offer pressure sensitivity, in-\/range detection (being able to control the cursor while not yet touching the tablet/screen surface), and often the ability to flip the pen for eraser-\/like behavior.

Pens are represented by the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen}}} Device layout implemented by the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen}}} class. Pens are based on the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pointers}{{\ttfamily Pointer}}{0} layout.

You can query the last used or last added pen with \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_current}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen.\+current}}}.

\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}{\bfseries{Note}}\+: \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} Pen/tablet support is currently implemented on Windows, UWP, i\+OS, and Android. mac\+OS is supported in \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} 2020.\+1+. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} Some devices support tracking multiple pens independently. \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity}\textquotesingle{}s Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} doesn\textquotesingle{}t support this currently. \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} i\+OS\+: The double-\/tap interaction on the side of the Apple Pencil is not surfaced as input at the moment. Also, no in-\/range detection is supported and \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_inRange}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily in\+Range}}} will remain at its default value.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1504}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Controls}{Controls}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1504}

{\bfseries{Pressure\+:}} You can access the pen\textquotesingle{}s current pressure via \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pointer.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pointer_pressure}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen.\+pressure}}}, where 0 means no pressure, and 1 means maximum pressure. However, pressure can go over 1 if the system applies a custom pressure curve where a pressure value of 1 doesn\textquotesingle{}t require pressing the pen down all the way to the maximum force the hardware supports. If a pen doesn\textquotesingle{}t support different pressure levels, the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pointer.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pointer_pressure}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily pressure}}} Control always returns 1.

{\bfseries{Tilt\+:}} If supported, the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_tilt}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen.\+tilt}}} Control represents the angle at which the pen tilts towards the tablet or screen surface. The X and Y axes correspond to the respective screen axes. A value of 1 on either axis means that the pen is fully parallel to the tablet or screen surface on that axis. A value of 0 means that the pen is perpendicular to the tablet or screen surface on that axis. If a pen doesn\textquotesingle{}t support tilt angles, {\ttfamily Pen.\+tilt} is always {\ttfamily (0,0)}.

{\bfseries{Twist\+:}} Some pens also support twist detection (the pen rotating around its own axis). If supported, \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_twist}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Pen.\+twist}}} represents the current rotation, where 0 means that the pen is facing up towards the Y axis, and values close to 1 mean that the pen is fully rotated clockwise around its own axis.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1506}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{In-\/range detection}{In-\/range detection}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1506}
A pen might not need to touch the tablet or screen surface in order to be able to control the cursor. You can use the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_inRange}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily in\+Range}}} button Control to determine whether the pen is currently in detection range. If \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_inRange}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily in\+Range}}} reports as pressed, the pen registers with the tablet or screen. For Devices that don\textquotesingle{}t support this feature, \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_inRange}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily in\+Range}}} always reports as pressed.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1507}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Barrel buttons}{Barrel buttons}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_pen_autotoc_md1507}
Pen Devices often have one or multiple buttons on the side of the pen. These are represented by the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_firstBarrelButton}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily first\+Barrel\+Button}}}, \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_secondBarrelButton}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily second\+Barrel\+Button}}}, \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_thirdBarrelButton}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily third\+Barrel\+Button}}}, and \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.Pen.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_Pen_fourthBarrelButton}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily fourth\+Barrel\+Button}}} where applicable.
