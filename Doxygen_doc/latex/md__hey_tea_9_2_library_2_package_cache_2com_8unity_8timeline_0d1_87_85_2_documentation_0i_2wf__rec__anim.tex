 You can record animation directly to an Animation track. When you record directly to an empty Animation track, you create an {\bfseries{Infinite clip}}.

An Infinite clip is a clip that contains basic key animation recorded through the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window. An Infinite clip cannot be positioned, trimmed, or split because it does not have a defined size\+: it spans the entirety of an Animation track.

Before creating an Infinite clip, you must \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2trk__add}{add an empty Animation track}{0} for the Game\+Object that you want to animate.

In the Track list, click the red circular Record button for the empty Animation track to enable Record mode.



{\itshape Click the Record button on an empty track to enable Record mode}

When a track is in Record mode, the clip area of the track is drawn in red with the "{}\+Recording..."{} message, and the Record button blinks on and off.

When in Record mode, any modification to an animatable property of the Game\+Object sets a key at the location of the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead.

To start creating an animation, move the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Playhead to the location of the first key, and do {\bfseries{one}} of the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In the Inspector window, right-\/click the name of the property and choose {\bfseries{Add Key}}. This adds an animation key for the property without changing its value. A diamond appears in the Infinite clip to show the position of the key.
\item In the Inspector window, change the value of the animatable property of the Game\+Object. This adds an animation key for the property with its changed value. A diamond appears in the Infinite clip.
\item In the Scene view, either move, rotate, or scale the Game\+Object. This automatically adds a key for the properties you change. A diamond appears in the Infinite clip.
\end{DoxyItemize}



{\itshape Red background indicates that youâ€™ve added an animation curve for the property to the clip}



{\itshape Setting a key adds a diamond to the Infinite clip}

Move the playhead to a different position on the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} and change the animatable properties of the Game\+Object. At each position, the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window adds a diamond to the Infinite clip for any changed properties and adds a key to its associated animation curves.

While in Record mode, you can right-\/click the name of an animatable property name to perform keying operations such as setting a key without changing its value, jumping to the next or previous keys, and removing keys. For example, to set a key for the position of a Game\+Object without changing its value, right-\/click {\bfseries{Position}} and select {\bfseries{Add Key}} from the context menu.



{\itshape Right-\/click the name of an animatable property to perform keying operations}

When you finish the animation, click the blinking Record button to disable Record mode.

An Infinite clip appears as a dope sheet in the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window, but you cannot edit the keys in this view. Use \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8timeline_0d1_87_85_2_documentation_0i_2crv__keys__edit}{the Curves view to edit keys}{0}. You can also double-\/click the Infinite clip and edit the keys with the Animation window.

Save the Scene or Project to save the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset and the Infinite clip. The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window saves the key animation from the Infinite clip as a source asset. The source asset is named "{}\+Recorded"{} and saved as a child of the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset in the Project.



{\itshape Recorded clips are saved under the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset in the Project}

For every additional recorded Infinite clip, the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window numbers each clip sequentially, starting at "{}(1)"{}. For example, a \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset with three recorded Infinite clips are named "{}\+Recorded"{}, "{}\+Recorded (1)"{}, and "{}\+Recorded (2)"{}. If you delete a \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset, its recorded clips are also removed.
