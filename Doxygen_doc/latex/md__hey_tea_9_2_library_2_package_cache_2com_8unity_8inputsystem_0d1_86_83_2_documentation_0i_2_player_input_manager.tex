 \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}NOTE\+: The Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} package comes with a sample called {\ttfamily Simple Multiplayer} which you can install from the package manager UI in the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} editor. The sample demonstrates how to use \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} to set up a simple local multiplayer scenario.

The \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_player_input}{{\ttfamily Player Input}}{0} system facilitates setting up local multiplayer games, where multiple players share a single device with a single screen and multiple controllers. Set this up using the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} component, which automatically manages the creation and lifetime of {\ttfamily Player\+Input} instances as players join and leave the game.

You can use the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_PlayerInputManager_joinBehavior}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Join Behavior}}} property in the Inspector to determine how a \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} component decides when to add new players to the game. The following options are available to choose the specific mechanism that \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} employs.

Alternatively, create Game\+Objects with \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_player_input}{{\ttfamily Player\+Input}}{0} components directly and the Input \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} will automatically join them.   \\\cline{1-2}

If you enable the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_PlayerInputManager_splitScreen}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Split-\/\+Screen}}} option, the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} automatically splits the available screen space between the active players. For this to work, you must set the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInput.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_PlayerInput_camera}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Camera}}} property on the {\ttfamily Player\+Input} prefab. The \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager}}} then automatically resizes and repositions each camera instance to let each player have their own part of the screen.

If you enable the \href{../api/UnityEngine.InputSystem.PlayerInputManager.html\#UnityEngine_InputSystem_PlayerInputManager_splitScreen}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Split-\/\+Screen}}} option, you can configure the following additional properties in the Inspector\+:

By default, any player in the game can interact with any UI elements. However, in split-\/screen setups, your game can have screen-\/space UIs that are restricted to just one specific camera. See the \href{PlayerInput.md\#ui-input}{\texttt{ UI Input}} section on the \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Input component page on how to set this up using the \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Input component, \href{UISupport.md\#setting-up-ui-input}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module}}} and \href{UISupport.md\#multiplayer-uis}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Multiplayer\+Event\+System}}} components.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_player_input_manager_autotoc_md1521}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{{\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} notifications}{{\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} notifications}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_documentation_0i_2_player_input_manager_autotoc_md1521}
{\ttfamily Player\+Input\+Manager} sends notifications when something notable happens with the current player setup. These notifications are delivered according to the {\ttfamily Notification Behavior} property, in the \href{PlayerInput.md\#notification-behaviors}{\texttt{ same way as for {\ttfamily Player\+Input}}}.

Your game can listen to the following notifications\+:
