 This Virtual Camera {\bfseries{Body}} algorithm moves the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} camera in a variable relationship to the Virtual Camera’s {\bfseries{Follow}} target. It optionally accepts \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ConventionalGameInput.html}{\texttt{ player input}}, which allows the player to dynamically control the position of the camera relative to the target.

The {\bfseries{Orbital Transposer}} introduces the concept of {\bfseries{heading}}, which is the direction in which the target is moving or facing. Orbital Transposer attempts to position the camera so that it points in the same direction as the heading direction. By default, this position is directly behind the target. Control this relationship by adjusting the {\bfseries{Heading Bias}} property.

If you attach an input controller to the {\bfseries{Orbital Transposer}}, then the player can also control the camera. This allows the player to move the camera to any spot on an orbit around the target. Configure the {\bfseries{Orbital Transposer}} to take its input from any axis that you set up in the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html}{\texttt{ Input Manager}}. Or control the value directly using a custom input system.

{\bfseries{Orbital Transposer}} optionally re-\/centers the camera automatically. When {\bfseries{Recenter To Target Heading}} is checked, Orbital Transposer automatically moves the camera back to the target heading. You can specify the length of time to wait after it has detected no user input and the speed of the recentering.

&{\itshape Lock To Target On Assign}   &Makes the orientation of the virtual camera match the local frame of the Follow target, at the moment when the virtual camera is activated or when the target is assigned. This offset remains constant in world space. The camera doesn\textquotesingle{}t rotate along with the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target With World Up}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target with tilt and roll set to 0. This binding mode ignores all target rotations except yaw.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target No Roll}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target, with roll set to 0.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target. When the target rotates, the camera moves with it to maintain the offset and to maintain the same view of the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape World Space}   &The offset is interpreted in world space relative to the origin of the Follow target. The camera will not change position when the target rotates.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Simple Follow With World Up}   &Simple follow with world up interprets the offset and damping values in camera-\/local space. This mode emulates the action a human camera operator would take when instructed to follow a target. The camera attempts to move as little as possible to maintain the same distance from the target; the direction of the camera with regard to the target does not matter. Regardless of the orientation of the target, the camera tries to preserve the same distance and height from it.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Follow Offset}}   }&The position offset to attempt to maintain from the Follow target. You can also use \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2handles}{Scene Handles}{0} to modify this property.    \\\cline{1-3}

\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Heading}}   }&Specifies how to calculate the heading of the Follow target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Definition}   &Choose Position Delta to calculate heading based on the difference in the position of the target from the last update and the current frame. Choose Velocity to use the velocity of the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Rigidbody.html}{\texttt{ Rigidbody}} of the target. If the target has no Rigidbody component, reverts to Position Delta. Choose Target Forward to use the target\textquotesingle{}s local Forward axis as the heading. Choose World Forward to use a constant world-\/space Forward as heading.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Velocity Filter Strength}   &Controls the smoothing of the velocity when using Position Delta or Velocity in Definition.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Bias}   &Angular offset in the orbit to place the camera, relative to the heading. Measured in degrees. An axis value of 0 will put the camera here.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Recenter To Target Heading}}   }&Controls automatic recentering when the player gives no input.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Enabled}   &Check to enable automatic recentering.    \\\cline{1-3}

&{\itshape Max Speed}   &The maximum speed of this axis in degrees/second, or the multipler for the input value if Speed Mode is set to {\itshape Input\+Value\+Gain}.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Speed Mode}   &How the axis responds to input. {\itshape Max\+Speed} (the default) clamps the maximum speed at which the axis can change, regardless of the input. {\itshape Input Value Gain} multiplies the input value by Max\+Speed.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Accel Time}   &The amount of time in seconds to accelerate to Max\+Speed with the supplied axis at its maximum value.    \\\cline{1-3}
