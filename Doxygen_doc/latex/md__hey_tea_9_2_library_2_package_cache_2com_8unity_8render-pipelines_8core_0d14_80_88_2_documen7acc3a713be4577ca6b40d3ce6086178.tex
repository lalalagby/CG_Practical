 The Light Anchor can help to place light sources around subjects, in relation to a Camera and an anchor point. It\textquotesingle{}s particularly effective for cinematic lighting, which often requires multiple light sources orbiting a subject.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8core_0d14_80_88_2_documen7acc3a713be4577ca6b40d3ce6086178_autotoc_md1855}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Using the Light Anchor Component}{Using the Light Anchor Component}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8core_0d14_80_88_2_documen7acc3a713be4577ca6b40d3ce6086178_autotoc_md1855}
To add a Light Anchor component to a Game\+Object in your Scene\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Select a Light Game\+Object in the hierarchy to open its Inspector window.
\item Go to {\bfseries{Add Component}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Rendering}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Light Anchor}}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

By default, the Anchor\textquotesingle{}s position is the same as the position of the Game\+Object the Light Anchor Component is attached to.

{\bfseries{Note}}\+: To use the Light Anchor, you must set the Tag of at least one Camera to "{}\+Main\+Camera"{}.

Use the {\bfseries{Orbit}} and {\bfseries{Elevation}} to control the orientation of the light, in degrees, relative to the main Camera\textquotesingle{}s and Anchor\textquotesingle{}s positions. If the Light has a Cookie or an IES Profile, use the {\bfseries{Roll}} to change their orientation. Use the {\bfseries{Distance}} to control how far from the anchor, in meters, you want to place the Light.

You can use the {\bfseries{Anchor Position Override}} to provide a Game\+Objectâ€™s \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.html}{\texttt{ Transform}} as an anchor point for the Light. This is useful if you want the Light to follow a specific Game\+Object in the Scene.



{\bfseries{Note}}\+: The above example uses the Main Camera as the reference Camera that adjusts the light rotation. The Common presets might create a different result in the Scene View if your view isn\textquotesingle{}t aligned with the Main Camera.

You can set a {\bfseries{Position Offset}} for this custom Anchor. This is useful if the Transform position of the custom Anchor isn\textquotesingle{}t centered appropriately for the light to orbit correctly around the custom Anchor.



The Light Anchor component also includes a list of {\bfseries{Presets}} that you can use to set the Light\textquotesingle{}s orientation relative to the main Camera.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8core_0d14_80_88_2_documen7acc3a713be4577ca6b40d3ce6086178_autotoc_md1856}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties}{Properties}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8core_0d14_80_88_2_documen7acc3a713be4577ca6b40d3ce6086178_autotoc_md1856}
