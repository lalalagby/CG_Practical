\item New Noise\+Settings editor with signal preview
\item Added Focal Length or Named FOV presets for Camera Lens
\item Added support for Physical Camera\+: focal length and Lens Offset
\item New improved Group framing algorithm\+: tighter group framing in Group\+Composer and Framing\+Transposer
\item Collider\+: now returns Target\+Is\+Obscured if the target is offscreen (great for cameras with fixed aim)
\item Collider\+: added Minimum Occlusion Time setting, to ignore fleeting obstructions
\item Collider\+: added Transparent Layers mask, to specify solid objects that don\textquotesingle{}t obstruct view
\item Collider\+: damping will no longer take the camera through obstacles
\item Collider\+: Added separate damping setting for when target is being occluded vs when camera is being returned to its normal position
\item Collider\+: added Smoothing setting, to reduce camera jumpiness in environements with lots of obstacles
\item Noise\+Settings\+: added checkbox for pure sine-\/wave instead of Perlin wave
\item If no Look\+At target, Post\+Processing Focus\+Tracks\+Target offset is relative to camera
\item Tracked\+Dolly\+: Default up mode sets Up to World Up
\item Virtual Camera\+: New Transitions section in inspector that gives more control over blending\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Blend Hint provides some control over how the position and rotation are interpolated
\item Inherit Position checkbox to ensure smooth positional handoff from outgoing camera
\item On\+Camera\+Live event gets fired when the camera activates. Useful for custom handlers.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Added Screen\+Space\+Aim\+When\+Targets\+Differ as a vcam blend hint. This influences what happens when blending between vcams with different Look\+At targets
\item Increased stability of vcams with very small FOVs
\item Framing Transposer no longer requires Look\+At to be null
\item Lens\+Settings Aspect, Orthographic, Is\+Physical\+Camera, Sensor\+Size properties no longer internal
\item Noise Profiles\+: don\textquotesingle{}t magically create assets. Prompt user for filename and location of new or cloned profiles
\item Refactored interaction between timeline and CM brain, to improve handling of edge cases (fogbugz case 1048497)
\item Bugfix\+: State\+Driven\+Camera Editor was not finding states if target was Override\+Controller
\item Bugfix when dragging orbital transposer transform\+: take bias into account
\item Bugfix\+: \doxylink{namespace_save_during_play}{Save\+During\+Play} was not handling asset fields correctly -\/ was sometimes crushing assets
\item Bugfix\+: Simple\+Follow transposers were not initilizing their position correctly at game start
\item Bugfix\+: \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} with CM shot was causing jitter in some Fixed\+Update situations
\item Bugfix\+: Multiple brains with heterogeneous update methods were not behaving correctly. CM will now support this, but you must make sure that the brains have different layer masks.
\item Example scenes now include use of Cinemachine\+Trigger\+Action script. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Bugfix\+: Custom Blends "{}\+Any to Any"{} was not working (regression)
\item Bugfix\+: Composer was sometimes getting wrong aspect if multiple brains with different aspect ratios
\item Bugfix\+: could not drag vcam transforms if multiple inspectors and one is hidden
\item Bugfix\+: Framing Transposer initializes in the wrong place -\/ noticeable if dead zone
