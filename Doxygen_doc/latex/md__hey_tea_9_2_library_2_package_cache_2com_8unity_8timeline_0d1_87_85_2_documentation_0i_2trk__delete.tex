 Delete a track to remove the track, its clips, blends, and properties from the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window. This is a destructive action that modifies a \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset and affects all \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instances based on the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset.

There are many ways to delete tracks\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Select a track and press the {\bfseries{Delete}} key (or hold {\bfseries{Command}} and press {\bfseries{Delete}}).
\item Select a track. Right-\/click an empty area in the Track list and select {\bfseries{Delete}} from the context menu.
\item Right-\/click a track and select {\bfseries{Delete}} from the context menu.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Deleting an Animation track also deletes the recorded Infinite clips for Animation clips that were converted from Infinite clips. The Project window may still show recorded Infinite clips as children of a \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset because it is not updated until you save the Scene or Project.

You cannot delete a locked track.
