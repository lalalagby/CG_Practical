 This section answers some frequently asked questions about the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). These questions come from the \href{https://forum.unity.com/forums/general-graphics.76/}{\texttt{ General Graphics}} section on our forums, from the \href{https://discord.gg/unity}{\texttt{ Unity Discord}} channel, and from our support teams.

For information about the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), see the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html}{\texttt{ HDRP documentation}}.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2112}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Can I use URP and HDRP at the same time?}{Can I use URP and HDRP at the same time?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2112}
No. They\textquotesingle{}re both built with the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP), but their render paths and light models are different.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2113}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Can I convert from one pipeline to the other?}{Can I convert from one pipeline to the other?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2113}
You can convert from the Built-\/in Render Pipeline to URP. To do so, you\textquotesingle{}ll have to re-\/write your Assets and redo the lighting in your game or app. See this upgrade guide on \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do725301a77635678c75535ca740a1ac66}{installing URP into an existing Project}{0}.

You can use our upgrader to \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do95ff25160875704a67e3dc7190307069}{upgrade Built-\/in Shaders to the URP Shaders}{0}. For custom Shaders, you\textquotesingle{}ll have to upgrade them manually.

You {\itshape should not} swap pipeline Assets from one pipeline to another at run time, and there\textquotesingle{}s no upgrader between URP and HDRP.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2114}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How do I update the Universal Render Pipeline package?}{How do I update the Universal Render Pipeline package?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2114}
You should update via the Package Manager. In the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Editor, go to {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity}}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Window}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Package Manager}}, and find the {\bfseries{Universal RP}} package.

If you’ve added SRP code or Shader Graph manually via Github, make sure to upgrade them to the same package version as URP in your manifest file.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2115}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Where has Dynamic Batching gone?}{Where has Dynamic Batching gone?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2115}
The Dynamic Batching checkbox has moved from the {\bfseries{\doxylink{class_player}{Player} Settings}} to the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do6a4fd81cefe986341b093c28ca9c1f30}{{\bfseries{URP Asset}}}{0}.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2116}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How do I enable Double Sided Global Illumination in the Editor?}{How do I enable Double Sided Global Illumination in the Editor?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2116}
In the Material Inspector, find {\bfseries{Render Face}}, and select {\bfseries{Both}}. This means that both sides of your geometry contribute to global illumination, because URP doesn’t cull either side.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2117}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Is this render pipeline usable for desktop apps and games?}{Is this render pipeline usable for desktop apps and games?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2117}
Yes. The graphics quality and performance is scalable across platforms, so you can create apps for PCs and consoles as well as mobile devices.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2118}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{A certain feature from the Built-\/in Render Pipeline is not supported in URP.

Yes. You can \href{https://portal.productboard.com/8ufdwj59ehtmsvxenjumxo82/tabs/3-Universal-render-pipeline}{\texttt{ check it here}}. You can add suggestions as well. To do so, you’ll have to enter your email address, but you won’t have to make an account.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2120}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{I’ve found a bug.

You can open bugs by using the \href{https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting}{\texttt{ bug reporter system}}. URP bugs go through the same process as all other \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} bugs. You can also check the active list of bugs for URP in the \href{https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/product/unity/issues?utf8=\%E2\%9C\%93&package=2&unity_version=&status=1&category=&view=hottest}{\texttt{ issue tracker}}.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2121}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{I’ve upgraded my Project from the Built-\/in render pipeline to URP, but it’s not running faster.

URP and the Built-\/in Render Pipeline have different quality settings. While the Built-\/in Render Pipeline configures many settings in different places like the Quality Settings, \doxylink{namespace_graphics}{Graphics} Settings, and \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Settings, all URP settings are stored in the URP Asset. The first thing to do is to check whether your URP Asset settings match the settings your Built-\/in render pipeline Project. For example, if you disabled MSAA or HDR in your Built-\/in render pipeline Project, make sure they are disabled in the URP Asset in your URP Project. For advice on configuring URP Assets, see documentation on the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do6a4fd81cefe986341b093c28ca9c1f30}{URP Asset}{0}.

If, after comparing the settings, you still experience worse performance with URP, please \href{https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/bug-reporting}{\texttt{ open a bug report}} and attach your Project.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2122}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{URP doesn’t run on device X or platform Y.

We are looking into how to strip Shader keywords more aggressively. You can help the Shader stripper by disabling features you don’t require for your game in the URP Asset. For more information on settings that affect shader variants and build time, see the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do43e8342bb8e6afb50c3edb6128e5e8d5}{shader stripping documentation}{0}.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2124}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How do I set Camera clear flags in URP?}{How do I set Camera clear flags in URP?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2124}
You can set the Background Type in the Camera Inspector to control how a Camera\textquotesingle{}s color buffer is initialized.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2125}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{What rendering space does URP work in?}{What rendering space does URP work in?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2125}
By default, URP uses a linear color space while rendering. You can also use a gamma color space, which is non-\/linear. To do so, toggle it in the \doxylink{class_player}{Player} Settings.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2126}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How do I extend URP with scriptable render pass?}{How do I extend URP with scriptable render pass?}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_documentation_0i_2faq_autotoc_md2126}
To create a scriptable render pass, you have to create a {\ttfamily Scriptable\+Renderer\+Feature} script. This is because the scriptable render feature is a container that can have the pass in it. To create the scriptable render feature in the Editor, click on {\bfseries{Asset}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Create}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Rendering}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Universal Render Pipeline}} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} {\bfseries{Renderer Feature}}.
