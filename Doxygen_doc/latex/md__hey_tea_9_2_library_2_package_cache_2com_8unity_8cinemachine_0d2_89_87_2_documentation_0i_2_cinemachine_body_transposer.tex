 This Virtual Camera {\bfseries{Body}} algorithm moves the Virtual Camera in a fixed offset to the {\bfseries{Follow}} target. It also applies damping.

The fixed offset can be interpreted in various ways, depending on the Binding Mode.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_body_transposer_autotoc_md659}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_body_transposer_autotoc_md659}

&{\itshape Lock To Target On Assign}   &Makes the orientation of the virtual camera match the local frame of the Follow target, at the moment when the virtual camera is activated or when the target is assigned. This offset remains constant in world space. The camera does not rotate along with the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target With World Up}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target with tilt and roll set to 0. This binding mode ignores all target rotations except yaw.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target No Roll}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target, with roll set to 0.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Lock To Target}   &Makes the virtual camera use the local frame of the Follow target. When the target rotates, the camera moves with it to maintain the offset and to maintain the same view of the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape World Space}   &The offset is interpreted in world space relative to the origin of the Follow target. The camera will not change position when the target rotates.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Simple Follow With World Up}   &Simple follow with world up interprets the offset and damping values in camera-\/local space. This mode emulates the action a human camera operator would take when instructed to follow a target. The camera attempts to move as little as possible to maintain the same distance from the target; the direction of the camera with regard to the target does not matter. Regardless of the orientation of the target, the camera tries to preserve the same distance and height from it.    \\\cline{1-3}
