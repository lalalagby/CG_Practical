Rather than adapting UIs for gamepad navigation/use, an oft-\/used alternative is to instead keep having UIs operated by pointer input but to drive the pointer from gamepad input.

This sample demonstrates how to set this up with the input system.



1) It uses a custom \href{./GamepadMouseCursorUIActions.inputactions}{\texttt{ actions file}} for feeding input to the UI as the default actions are set up for gamepad navigation -- something we don\textquotesingle{}t want here as it would conflict with gamepad input being used for virtual cursor navigation. 2) Note how {\ttfamily Input\+System\+UIInput\+Module} on the {\ttfamily Event\+System} Game\+Object is set up to reference actions from that file. 3) The key component to take a look at is {\ttfamily Virtual\+Mouse\+Input} on {\ttfamily Canvas \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Cursor}. The component is set up to receive input from the gamepad and translates it into motion on the {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} it is given. When going into play mode, you should also see a {\ttfamily Virtual Mouse} being added to the devices by the component. 4) Note how the anchor position on the {\ttfamily Rect\+Transform} is set to bottom left. This way the coordinate system responds to how mouse screen space operates. 5) Note how {\ttfamily Cursor} is the last child of {\ttfamily Canvas} so that it draws on top of everything else. 6) Note that {\ttfamily Raycast Target} on the {\ttfamily Image} component of the cursor is turned off to avoid raycasts from the mouse cursor hitting the cursor itself. 7) Note that {\ttfamily Cursor Mode} on the {\ttfamily Virtual\+Mouse\+Input} component is set to {\ttfamily Hardware Cursor If Available}. This will cause the component to look for a system mouse. If present, the system mouse is disabled and the system mouse cursor is warped to the virtual mouse position using {\ttfamily Mouse.\+Warp\+Cursor\+Position}. If no system mouse is present, {\ttfamily Cursor Graphic} will be used as a software mouse cursor.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_samples_0i_2_gamepad_mouse_cursor_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1613}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Licenses}{Licenses}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8inputsystem_0d1_86_83_2_samples_0i_2_gamepad_mouse_cursor_2_r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md1613}
