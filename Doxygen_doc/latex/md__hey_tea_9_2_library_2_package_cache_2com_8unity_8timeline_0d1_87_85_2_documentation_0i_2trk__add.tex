 The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window supports many different methods of adding tracks to the Track list. Depending on the method you choose, the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window may also add track bindings to the Track header, clips to tracks, and components to Game\+Objects.



{\itshape Add Track menu}

The simplest method to add a track is to click the {\bfseries{Add}} button and select the type of track from the {\bfseries{Add Track}} drop-\/down menu. You can also right-\/click an empty area of the Track list to make the {\bfseries{Add Track}} menu appear.

The \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window also supports dragging a Game\+Object into the Track list. Drag a Game\+Object into an empty area in the Track list and select the type of track to add from the context menu. Depending on the type of track selected, the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window performs different actions\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Select {\bfseries{Animation Track}} and the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window binds the Game\+Object to the Animation track. If the Game\+Object doesn\textquotesingle{}t already have an Animator component, the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window creates an Animator component for the Game\+Object.
\item Select {\bfseries{Activation Track}} and the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window binds the Game\+Object to the Activation track. There are some limitations when creating an Activation track when dragging a Game\+Object. For example, the main Game\+Object with the Playable Directory component should not be bound to an Activation track. Because this is the same Game\+Object that links the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} Asset to the Scene, activating and disabling the Game\+Object affects the length of \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} instance.
\item Select {\bfseries{Audio Track}} and the \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline} window adds an Audio Source component to the Game\+Object and binds this Audio Source component to the Audio track.
