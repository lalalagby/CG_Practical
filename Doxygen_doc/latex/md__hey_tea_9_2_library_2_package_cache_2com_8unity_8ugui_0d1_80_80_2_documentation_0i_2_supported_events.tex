 The Event \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} supports a number of events, and they can be customized further in user custom user written Input Modules.

The events that are supported by the Standalone Input Module and Touch Input Module are provided by interface and can be implemented on a Mono\+Behaviour by implementing the interface. If you have a valid Event \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} configured the events will be called at the correct time.
