 To create projects\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item In \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity}, open the version control window and click on {\bfseries{Create Workspace}}. It will suggest names for your repository (shared files and history) and workspace (your local copy).
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

If you wish to use an existing version control repository, click the three dots next to the repository name, and select a repository from the list.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Select the type of workspace that fits your needs.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{local workspace}} With this workspace, you can work with branching and merging.
\item {\bfseries{Gluon workspace}} This workspace tailored for artists allows you to pick the files you want to work on and check them back in without updating your whole workspace.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Add asset files associated with your project. version control will display the project files from the asset folder in the {\bfseries{Pending changes}} tab. You can choose specific files to include or add all to the repository by selecting the files and clicking Checkin changes.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

version control will automatically perform a check in for appropriate folders and files – such as package files and project settings – when it’s set up from the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Editor. You can view these in the {\bfseries{Changesets tab.}}

Once your initial asset check in is complete, you’re set up with version control for \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} and ready to create.
