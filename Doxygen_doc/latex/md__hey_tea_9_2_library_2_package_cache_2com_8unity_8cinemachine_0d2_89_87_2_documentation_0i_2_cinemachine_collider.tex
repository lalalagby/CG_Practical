 {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider}} is an \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_414e015286be387e4fe85aa25dd01df7}{extension}{0} for the \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Virtual Camera. It post-\/processes the final position of the Virtual Camera to attempt to preserve the line of sight with the {\bfseries{Look At}} target of the Virtual Camera. It does this by moving away from the Game\+Objects that obstruct the view.

Add a \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider extension to a \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Virtual Camera to do any of the following tasks\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Push the camera away from obstructing obstacles in the Scene.
\item Place the camera in front of obstacles that come between the Virtual Camera and its {\bfseries{Look At}} target.
\item Evaluate shot quality. {\bfseries{Shot quality}} is a measure of the distance of the Virtual Camera from its ideal position, the distance of the Virtual Camera to its target, and the obstacles that block the view of the target. Other modules use shot quality, including \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_clear_shot}{Clear Shot}{0}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The Collider uses a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/script-PhysicsRaycaster.html}{\texttt{ Physics Raycaster}}. Therefore, \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider requires that potential obstacles have \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html}{\texttt{ collider}} volumes. There is a performance cost for this requirement. If this cost is prohibitive in your game, consider implementing this functionality in a different way.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_collider_autotoc_md665}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_collider_autotoc_md665}

\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Collide Against}}   }&\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider considers Game\+Objects in these layers to be potential obstacles. It ignores Game\+Objects that are not in the selected layers.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Minimum Distance From Target}}   }&Ignore obstacles that are less than this distance from the target\textquotesingle{}s pivot point.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Avoid Obstacles}}   }&Check to allow the Collider to move the camera in the Scene when the target is obscured by an obstacle. Use the Distance Limit, Camera Radius, and Strategy properties to adjust how to avoid obstacles. If left unchecked, the \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider will report shot quality based on obstacles, but will not attempt to move the camera to improve the shot.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Distance Limit}}   }&The maximum raycast distance when checking if the line of sight to this cameraâ€™s target is clear. Enter 0 to use the current actual distance to the target. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Camera Radius}}   }&Distance to maintain from any obstacle. Try to keep this value small for best results. Increase it if you are seeing inside obstacles due to a large FOV on the camera. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Strategy}}   }&The way in which the Collider attempts to preserve sight of the target. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Pull Camera Forward}   &Move the camera forward along its Z axis until it is in front of the obstacle that is nearest to the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Preserve Camera Height}   &Move the camera to an alternate point of view while attempting to keep the camera at its original height.    \\\cline{1-3}
&{\itshape Preserve Camera Distance}   &Move the camera to an alternate point of view while attempting to keep the camera at its original distance from the target.    \\\cline{1-3}
{\bfseries{Smoothing Time}}   &&Minimum number of seconds to hold the camera at the nearest point to the target. Can be used to reduce excess camera movement in environments with lots of obstacles. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Damping}}   }&How quickly to return the camera to its normal position after an occlusion has gone away. Small numbers make the camera more responsive. Larger numbers make the camera respond more slowly. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Damping When Occluded}}   }&How quickly to move the camera to avoid an obstacle. Small numbers make the camera more responsive. Larger numbers make the camera respond more slowly. Available when Avoid Obstacles is checked.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Optimal Target Distance}}   }&If greater than zero, give a higher score to shots when the target is closer to this distance. Set this property to 0 to disable this feature.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Transparent Layers}}   }&Objects on these layers will never obstruct the view of the target.    \\\cline{1-3}

\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Maximum Effort}}   }&Upper limit on how many obstacle hits to process. Higher numbers may impact performance. In most environments four (4) hits is enough.    \\\cline{1-3}
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{{\bfseries{Ignore Tag}}   }&Obstacles with this tag will be ignored. It is recommended to set this field to the target\textquotesingle{}s tag.   \\\cline{1-3}
