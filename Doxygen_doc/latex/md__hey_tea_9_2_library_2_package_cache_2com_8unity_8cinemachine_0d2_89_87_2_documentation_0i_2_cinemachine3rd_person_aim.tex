 This extension is created to be a part of a 3rd-\/person camera rig. ~\newline


To preserve aiming accuracy, this extension deliberately cancels out all rotational noise, and forces a hard look at the target point. However, it\textquotesingle{}s still possible to use camera noise with this extension, provided that the noise affects the camera position, instead of the rotation.

See the {\bfseries{Aiming\+Rig}} sample scene for an example of this.

Additionally, if {\itshape Aim Target Reticle} is non-\/null, this extension will project a ray from the Follow target\textquotesingle{}s position and find the first object that collides with that ray. The Aim Target Reticle object will then be placed on that point in the Game View, to indicate what the player would hit if a shot were to be fired. This point may be different from what the camera is looking at, if the found object is close enough to be affected by parallax as a result of the offset between player and camera.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine3rd_person_aim_autotoc_md483}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine3rd_person_aim_autotoc_md483}
