 {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Path}} is a component that defines a world-\/space path, consisting of an array of waypoints. Each waypoint specifies position, tangent, and roll settings. Bezier interpolation is performed between the waypoints, to get a smooth and continuous path.

{\bfseries{Tip}}\+: While the path position will always be smooth and continuous, it is still possible to get jarring movement when animating along the path. This happens when tangents arenâ€™t set to ensure continuity of both the first and second order derivatives. It is not easy to get this right. To avoid this potentially jarring movement, use \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Smooth Path. Cinemachine\+Smooth\+Path sets the tangents automatically to ensure complete smoothness.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_path_autotoc_md709}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_path_autotoc_md709}
