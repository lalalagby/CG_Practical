Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings). -\/ Fixed a bug where we could leave background tasks around forever when we had actually completed them (could only happen if two re-\/compilation requests arrived close together, meaning we\textquotesingle{}d cancel the first but never report to the background tasks that we had cancelled them!). -\/ Fix the Burst $<$tt$>$link.\+xml$<$/tt$>$ output to preserve C\# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously. -\/ Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters -\/ Fixed a bug where if you used $<$tt$>$\+Float\+Mode.\+Fast$<$/tt$>$ with $<$tt$>$math.\+pow$<$/tt$>$, where the $<$tt$>$y$<$/tt$>$ argument to $<$tt$>$math.\+pow$<$/tt$>$ was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (\+LLVM would try and call out to $<$tt$>$powf$<$/tt$>$ from the cstdlib). -\/ Worked around an ordering issue with post-\/processing in 2020.\+3 and earlier by deferring the early compilation of script assemblies in the editor until the entire pipeline has completed. -\/ Fixed a bug in 2022.\+1+ where calling $<$tt$>$\+Debug.\+Log$<$/tt$>$ in a static constructor would result in a Burst failure. -\/ Fixed another rare case of the file-\/is-\/locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb. -\/ Fixed a bug when calling profiling $<$tt$>$\+Create\+Marker$<$/tt$>$ on i\+OS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find $<$tt$>$\+Create\+Marker\+\_\+\+\_\+\+Unmanaged$<$/tt$>$. -\/ Fixed that the $<$tt$>$crc32\+\_\+u64$<$/tt$>$ second parameter should have been a $<$tt$>$ulong$<$/tt$>$.

$<$tt$>$\+Reinterpret\+Store(some\+Index, (ushort)some\+Value)$<$/tt$>$ could cause an internal compiler error in Burst. -\/ Fixed a potential deadlock whereby if Burst was compiling in the background (the background tasks window showed Burst in it) and a user switched from release to debug in the editor, Burst could cause a deadlock. -\/ A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module -\/ Fixed hashing error that could occur with unbound generic type -\/ Fixed a bug where if you had synchronous compilation on a job, disabled Burst compilation and entered playmode, then exited playmode, and finally re-\/enabled Burst compilation, a hang could occur. -\/ Fixed a bug where toggling Burst enable $<$-\/$>$ disable during a playmode execution using Burst, and then attaching the managed debugger, could cause an editor crash. -\/ Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we\textquotesingle{}d pin a GC object and never unpin and free it. -\/ Fix burst inspector sometimes stalling during loading for script reloads. -\/ Fixed a super rare bug where Burst could hit an internal error with $<$tt$>$\+System.\+Invalid\+Operation\+Exception\+: Nullable object must have a value$<$/tt$>$. -\/ Fixed a regression where out parameters of C\# 9.\+0 function pointers weren\textquotesingle{}t working in Burst. -\/ Fixed internal compiler error when encountering a $<$tt$>$calli$<$/tt$>$ with closed generics -\/ Fixed bug in static constructor ordering in the presence of indirect

indices used were not already 32-\/bit signed integers, an internal compiler error would occur if running with safety checks enabled. -\/ Fixed a really convoluted bug that could manifest in Burst returning out of date cached libraries, which would manifest as random exceptions in Burst jobs/function-\/pointers (users deleting the Burst\+Cache would workaround the bug).  @subsection

$<$tt$>$\+Read\+Only\+Span$<$/tt$>$ would cause a compiler error. -\/ Fixed a codegen issue with Unity 2021.\+2 and $<$tt$>$\+System.\+Buffer.\+Memory\+Copy$<$/tt$>$. -\/ Fixed compiler crash when trying to load a generic static field -\/ Fixed "{}Unity\+Exception\+: Compile\+Async\+Delegate\+Method can only be called from the main thread."{} error that was logged in standalone players when the first invocation of a direct-\/call method was from a background thread -\/ Fix the very rare bug whereby the Burst Hash Cache files (\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.\+bhc) will sometimes cause an

conversions on platforms that did not natively support half could cause linker errors. -\/ Fix error when trying to Direct Call a method belonging to a private nested type -\/ Fixed some memory leaks between the C\# and C++ parts of the Burst compiler, and added some CI tooling to ensure this doesn\textquotesingle{}t happen again. -\/ Fixed a bug where our $<$tt$>$\mbox{[}\+Burst\+Compile\mbox{]}$<$/tt$>$ job finding code would not find methods in generic base classes in places where we knew the concrete-\/generic type (for instance $<$tt$>$struct

This change was required because the Burst compiler has to produce deterministic results from any given compile, which is fundamentally opposed to per-\/entry-\/point function derivations. -\/ Changed how SLEEF global variables for trig functions are pulled into Burst to reduce duplications. -\/ Changed how exceptions throw types and messages are stored in our Burst binaries to reduce binary size. -\/ Constant array data is now named after the static field it belongs to in assembly -\/ Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.\+0.\+1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. -\/ The $<$tt$>$\+Unity.\+Burst.\+Intrinsics.\+Common.\+Pause$<$/tt$>$ intrinsic is no longer experimental. -\/ DOTS Runtime shares the logging code path with the general case -\/ Armv8.\+2 Neon intrinsics are now fully supported -\/ Disable threading within the $<$tt$>$lld$<$/tt$>$ linker instances we use for in-\/editor and desktop cross compilation, because we\textquotesingle{}re already threading seperate process instances of $<$tt$>$lld$<$/tt$>$ and it results in lot of OS context switching. -\/ Tweaked how the IL Post Processed \textquotesingle{}direct call\textquotesingle{} Burst function pointers are compiled so that the compilation is deferred until they are needed (previously we\textquotesingle{}d enqueue them all for compilation on a domain reload). -\/ Changed Burst minimum editor version to 2019.\+4 -\/ Use rpmalloc as our native allocator on Windows to speed up concurrently executing LLVM work. -\/ When Burst has previously compiled a method, and neither the assembly containing that method nor any of that assembly\textquotesingle{}s dependencies have changed, it was possible after a domain reload for the Mono version of the method to be used for a short time before being replaced by the Burst version. This has now been improved such that the Burst version will be used immediately. -\/ Improved iteration speed by reducing the time it takes for Burst to check if any Burst-\/compilable code has changed -\/ Change our link step to not use response files if the command line was smaller enough, saving the cost of the round-\/trip to the disk. -\/ Made half $<$-\/$>$ float / double conversions use native hardware where possible (\+Arm or AVX2 targets). -\/ In order to prevent conflicts with the main Unity process, Burst is now inactive in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-\/of-\/process profiler. This means that in those secondary processes, code that would normally be Burst-\/compiled will now run under Mono. In a future release of Burst, we hope to lift this restriction and allow Burst-\/compiled code to run in secondary Unity processes.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md96 Fixed -\/ Fixed a bug in LLVM that it

direct call would cause duplicate function pointers to be compiled, wasting compile time in the editor and caused an Editor launch stall. -\/ Corrected \textquotesingle{}\+Enable safety checks tooltip$<$tt$>$. -\/ Fixed a minor debug information bug where built-\/in types with methods (like$<$/tt$>$\+System.\+Int32$<$tt$>$) would generate incorrect debug information. -\/ Fixed a very obscure bug where if you had a function-\/pointer that was called from another function-\/pointer of job, and that function-\/pointer happened to be compiled in a player build in the same bucket as the caller, and the no-\/alias cloning analysis identified that it could clone the original function-\/pointer to enable more aliasing optimizations, it could create a duplicate symbol error. -\/ Revert to internal linkage for Android X86 (32bit) to ensure ABI compliance. -\/ Fixed compilation errors when targeting Arm CPUs and using some of the Intel intrinsics -\/ Added Preserve\+Attribute to prevent the internal log from being stripped in il2cpp builds. -\/ IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation updated to handle transforms that affect instructions that are the destination of a branch. -\/ IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation now uses correct runtime library for dots runtime. -\/ Fixed compilation errors when targeting Intel CPUs and using some of the Arm Neon intrinsics -\/ Fixed a bug where eager-\/compilation could pick up out-\/of-\/date global Burst menu options for compiling. -\/ Fixed a bug where the progress bar would report double the amount of pending compile jobs if a user changed the Burst options while background compilation was going on. -\/ Fixed some intrinsics not checking target CPU against required CPU, so it was possible to use some intrinsics without an Is\+XXXSupported check -\/ Fixed a bug where having any$<$/tt$>$\mbox{[}\+Dll\+Import\mbox{]}$<$tt$>$in a class that used the Direct Call mechanism could result in an illegal$<$/tt$>$\+Compile\+Function\+Pointer$<$tt$>$call being produced by our post processor. -\/ Fixed an issue where if a user used a math function (like$<$/tt$>$cos$<$tt$>$,$<$/tt$>$sin$<$tt$>$, etc) then LLVM would preserve both the scalar and vector implementations even if they were trivially dead, causing us to inject otherwise dead functions into the resulting binary. -\/ PDB debug information for instance methods that also used struct return were incorrect. -\/ When generating Line Table only debug information, an unreachable could occur due to a missing check. -\/ Fixed the 1.\+5 restriction that Direct Call methods can only be called from the main thread, now they work when called from any thread. -\/ Internal Compiler Error if a call was discarded (via Burst\+Discard for example), but the callsites required an ABI transform e.\+g. struct return. -\/ Fixed a bug with using multiple$<$/tt$>$\+Is\+XXXSupported$<$tt$>$intrinsics in the same boolean condition would fail. -\/ Broken link restored for known issues with debugging and profiling. -\/ The Direct Call injected delegate now has a unique suffix to avoid type-\/name clashes. -\/ Dots runtime function pointer transform has been simplified, making it less brittle and fixing some bad IL generation. -\/ Fixed crashes on 32 bit windows when calling function pointers from managed code and using IL2\+CPP. -\/ Fixed a possible Divide\+By\+Zero\+Exception due to race condition in Term\+Info\+Driver initialization code. -\/ Fixed a bug where the multi-\/\+CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) could end up generating invalid instructions. -\/ Gracefully handle failing to find a particular assembly in the ILPP to prevent an ICE. -\/ function calls using in modifiers on blittable structs where being treated as non blittable. -\/ crash when extracting sequence point information for error reporting/debug information generation. -\/ Direct Call extension methods that only differ on argument types are now supported (previously Burst\textquotesingle{}s$<$/tt$>$\+Assembly\+Loader\`{} would complain about multiple matches). -\/ Fixed a regression where managed static fields, in static constructors that would also be compiled with Burst, could cause a compile time failure for mixing managed and unmanaged state.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md97 Added

attribute to let users specify compile options that should apply assembly wide (for instance $<$tt$>$\mbox{[}assembly\+: Burst\+Compile(\+Optimize\+For =

external function. -\/ An additional warning about delegates being used by $<$tt$>$\+Burst\+Compiler.\+Compile\+Function\+Pointer$<$/tt$>$ that are not decorated as expected. In most cases, Burst will automatically add the C-\/declaration attribute in IL Post Processing, but if the usage of Compile\+Function\+Pointer is abstracted away behind an open generic implementation, then Burst will not be able to automatically correct the delegate declaration, and thus this warning will fire. -\/ new $<$tt$>$burst\+\_\+\+Target\+Platform\+\_\+\+Embedded\+Linux$<$/tt$>$ -\/ new $<$tt$>$\+Aot\+Native\+Link\+Embedded\+Linux$<$/tt$>$ for Embedded\+Linux -\/ Added a new $<$tt$>$\+Optimize\+For$<$/tt$>$ mode $<$tt$>$\+Balanced$<$/tt$>$.

\item Add CPU minimum and maximum target for desktop platforms Standalone \doxylink{class_player}{Player} builds.
\item Append a newline between IRPass\+Diagnostic messages, fixes pass diagnostics readability in the inspector.
\item Add a new attribute {\ttfamily \mbox{[}Assume\+Range\mbox{]}} that lets users tag function parameters and returns of an integer type with a constrained range that the value is allowed to inhabit. {\ttfamily Native\+Array.\+Length} and {\ttfamily Native\+Slice.\+Length} have automatic detection that the property is always positive. This assumption feeds into the optimizer and can produce better codegen.
\item Enabled support for DOTS Runtime Shared\+Statics. Due to the nature of DOTS Runtime, only the generic versions of {\ttfamily Shared\+Static.\+Get\+Or\+Create\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}TContext\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} are supported.
\item Add a new intrinsic {\ttfamily Unity.\+Burst.\+Intrinsics.\+Common.\+Pause()} which causes a thread pause to occur for the current thread. This is useful for spin-\/locks to stop over contention on the lock.
\item Add some new \doxylink{namespace_burst}{Burst} aliasing deductions to substantially improve the aliasing detection in the compiler, resulting in better codegen.
\item Add syntax colouring to WASM.
\item Add {\ttfamily Is\+Created} to the {\ttfamily Function\+Pointer} class to allow checks on whether a given function pointer has a valid (non null) pointer within it.
\item Add AVX2 intrinsics
\item Add some missing intrinsics from SSE, SSE2 and AVX
\item Added explicit X86 intrinsics from SSE-\/\+AVX2.
\item AVX and AVX2 CPU targets are now available for x64 AOT builds.
\item Allow handle structs (structs with a single pointer/integer in them) to be inside another struct as long as they are the single member, as these require no ABI pain.
\item Added support for {\ttfamily Interlocked.\+Read}.
\item Added a new intrinsic {\ttfamily Common.\+umul128} which lets you get the low and high components of a 64-\/bit multiplication. This is especially useful for things like large hash creation.
