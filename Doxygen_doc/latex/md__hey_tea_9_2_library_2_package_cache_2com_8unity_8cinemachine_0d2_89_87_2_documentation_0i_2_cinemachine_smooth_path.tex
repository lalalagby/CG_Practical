 A {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Smooth Path}} is a component that defines a world-\/space path, consisting of an array of waypoints. Each waypoint has position and roll settings. \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} uses Bezier interpolation to calculate positions between the waypoints to get a smooth and continuous path. The path passes through all waypoints. Unlike \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Path, first and second order continuity is guaranteed, which means that not only the positions but also the angular velocities of objects animated along the path will be smooth and continuous.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_smooth_path_autotoc_md718}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_smooth_path_autotoc_md718}
