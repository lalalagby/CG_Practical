For all registered object types, record their state when exiting Play Mode, and restore that state to the objects in the scene. This is a very limited implementation which has not been rigorously tested with many objects types. It\textquotesingle{}s quite possible that not everything will be saved.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
For all registered object types, record their state when exiting Play Mode, and restore that state to the objects in the scene. This is a very limited implementation which has not been rigorously tested with many objects types. It\textquotesingle{}s quite possible that not everything will be saved. 

This class is expected to become obsolete when \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} implements this functionality in a more general way.

To use this functionality in your own scripts, add the \mbox{[}\doxylink{class_save_during_play_1_1_save_during_play}{Save\+During\+Play}\mbox{]} attribute to your class.

Note\+: if you want some specific field in your class NOT to be saved during play, add a property attribute whose class name contains the string "{}\+No\+Save\+During\+Play"{} and the field will not be saved. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}

Hey\+Tea!/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.\+unity.\+cinemachine@2.\+9.\+7/\+Editor/\+Utility/Save\+During\+Play.\+cs\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
