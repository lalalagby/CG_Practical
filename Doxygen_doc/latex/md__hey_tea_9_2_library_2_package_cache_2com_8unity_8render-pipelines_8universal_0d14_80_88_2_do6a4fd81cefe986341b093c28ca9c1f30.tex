 Any \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} project that uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) must have a URP Asset to configure the settings. When you create a project using the URP template, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} creates the URP Assets in the {\bfseries{Settings}} project folder and assigns them in Project Settings. If you are migrating an existing project to URP, you need to \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do725301a77635678c75535ca740a1ac66}{create a URP Asset and assign the asset in the Graphics settings}{0}.

The URP Asset controls several graphical features and quality settings for the Universal Render Pipeline. It is a scriptable object that inherits from ‘\+Render\+Pipeline\+Asset’. When you assign the asset in the \doxylink{namespace_graphics}{Graphics} settings, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} switches from the built-\/in render pipeline to the URP. You can then adjust the corresponding settings directly in the URP, instead of looking for them elsewhere.

You can have multiple URP assets and switch between them. For example, you can have one with Shadows on and one with Shadows off. If you switch between the assets to see the effects, you don’t have to manually toggle the corresponding settings for shadows every time. You cannot, however, switch between HDRP/\+SRP and URP assets, as the render pipelines are incompatible.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do6a4fd81cefe986341b093c28ca9c1f30_autotoc_md2525}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{UI overview}{UI overview}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do6a4fd81cefe986341b093c28ca9c1f30_autotoc_md2525}

{\bfseries{Depth Texture}}   &Enables URP to create a {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Camera\+Depth\+Texture}. URP then uses this \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-DepthTextures.html}{\texttt{ depth texture}} by default for all Cameras in your Scene. You can override this for individual cameras in the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_doc7c35c176c1ad0ea77080cb33c453ec9}{Camera Inspector}{0}.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Opaque Texture}}   &Enable this to create a {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+Camera\+Opaque\+Texture} as default for all cameras in your Scene. This works like the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-GrabPass.html}{\texttt{ Grab\+Pass}} in the built-\/in render pipeline. The {\bfseries{Opaque Texture}} provides a snapshot of the scene right before URP renders any transparent meshes. You can use this in transparent Shaders to create effects like frosted glass, water refraction, or heat waves. You can override this for individual cameras in the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_doc7c35c176c1ad0ea77080cb33c453ec9}{Camera Inspector}{0}.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Opaque Downsampling}}   &Set the sampling mode on the opaque texture to one of the following\+:~\newline
{\bfseries{None}}\+: Produces a copy of the opaque pass in the same resolution as the camera.~\newline
{\bfseries{2x Bilinear}}\+: Produces a half-\/resolution image with bilinear filtering.~\newline
{\bfseries{4x Box}}\+: Produces a quarter-\/resolution image with box filtering. This produces a softly blurred copy.~\newline
{\bfseries{4x Bilinear}}\+: Produces a quarter-\/resolution image with bi-\/linear filtering.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Terrain Holes}}   &If you disable this option, the URP removes all Terrain hole Shader variants when you build for the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} \doxylink{class_player}{Player}, which decreases build time.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{SRP Batcher}}   &Check this box to enable the SRP Batcher. This is useful if you have many different Materials that use the same Shader. The SRP Batcher is an inner loop that speeds up CPU rendering without affecting GPU performance. When you use the SRP Batcher, it replaces the SRP rendering code inner loop.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Dynamic Batching}}   &Enable \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/DrawCallBatching.html}{\texttt{ Dynamic Batching}}, to make the render pipeline automatically batch small dynamic objects that share the same Material. This is useful for platforms and graphics APIs that do not support GPU instancing. If your targeted hardware does support GPU instancing, disable {\bfseries{Dynamic Batching}}. You can change this at run time.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Debug Level}}   &Set the level of debug information that the render pipeline generates. The values are\+:~\newline
{\bfseries{Disabled}}\+: Debugging is disabled. This is the default.~\newline
{\bfseries{Profiling}}\+: Makes the render pipeline provide detailed information tags, which you can see in the Frame\+Debugger.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Shader Variant Log Level}}   &Set the level of information about Shader Stripping and Shader Variants you want to display when \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} finishes a build. Values are\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{Disabled}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} doesn’t log anything.~\newline
{\bfseries{Only Universal}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} logs information for all of the \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do172a57c066d9bcc5364ac933caa8ecae}{URP Shaders}{0}.~\newline
{\bfseries{All}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} logs information for all Shaders in your build.~\newline
 You can see the information in Console panel when your build has finished.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Store Actions}}   &Defines if \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} discards or stores the render targets of the Draw\+Objects Passes. Selecting the {\bfseries{Store}} option significantly increases the memory bandwidth on mobile and tile-\/based GPUs.~\newline
{\bfseries{Auto}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses the {\bfseries{Discard}} option by default, and falls back to the {\bfseries{Store}} option if it detects any injected Passes.~\newline
{\bfseries{Discard}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} discards the render targets of render Passes that are not reused later (lower memory bandwidth).~\newline
{\bfseries{Store}}\+: \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} stores all render targets of each Pass (higher memory bandwidth).   \\\cline{1-2}

These settings control the quality level of the URP. This is where you can make performance better on lower-\/end hardware or make graphics look better on higher-\/end hardware.

{\bfseries{Tip\+:}} If you want to have different settings for different hardware, you can configure these settings across multiple Universal Render Pipeline assets, and switch them out as needed.

{\bfseries{HDR}}   &Enable this to allow rendering in High Dynamic Range (HDR) by default for every camera in your Scene. With HDR, the brightest part of the image can be greater than 1. This gives you a wider range of light intensities, so your lighting looks more realistic. With it, you can still see details and experience less saturation even with bright light. This is useful if you want a wide range of lighting or to use \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessing-Bloom.html}{\texttt{ bloom}} effects. If you’re targeting lower-\/end hardware, you can disable this to skip HDR calculations and get better performance. You can override this for individual cameras in the Camera Inspector.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;HDR Precision   &The precision of the Camera color buffer in HDR rendering. The 64 bit precision lets you avoid banding artifacts, but requires higher bandwidth and might make sampling slower. Default value\+: 32 bit.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Anti Aliasing (MSAA)}}   &Use \href{anti-aliasing.md\#msaa}{\texttt{ Multisample Anti-\/aliasing}} by default for every Camera in your Scene while rendering. This softens edges of your geometry, so they’re not jagged or flickering. In the drop-\/down menu, select how many samples to use per pixel\+: {\bfseries{2x}}, {\bfseries{4x}}, or {\bfseries{8x}}. The more samples you choose, the smoother your object edges are. If you want to skip MSAA calculations, or you don’t need them in a 2D game, select {\bfseries{Disabled}}. You can override this for individual cameras in the Camera Inspector.~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} On mobile platforms that do not support the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rendering.RenderBufferStoreAction.StoreAndResolve.html}{\texttt{ Store\+And\+Resolve}} store action, if {\bfseries{Opaque Texture}} is selected in the URP asset, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} ignores the {\bfseries{Anti Aliasing (MSAA)}} property at runtime (as if Anti Aliasing (MSAA) is set to Disabled).    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Render Scale}}   &This slider scales the render target resolution (not the resolution of your current device). Use this when you want to render at a smaller resolution for performance reasons or to upscale rendering to improve quality. This only scales the game rendering. UI rendering is left at the native resolution for the device.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Upscaling Filter}}   &Select which image filter \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses when performing the upscaling. \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} performs upscaling when the Render Scale value is less than 1.\+0.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{Automatic}}   &\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} selects one of the filtering options based on the Render Scale value and the current screen resolution. If integer scaling is possible, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} selects the Nearest-\/\+Neighbor option, otherwise \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} selects the Bilinear option.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{Bilinear}}   &\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses the bilinear or linear filtering provided by the graphics API.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{Nearest-\/\+Neighbor}}   &\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses the nearest-\/neighbor or point sampling filtering provided by the graphics API.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{Fidelity\+FX Super Resolution\&\#160;1.\+0}}   &\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses the AMD Fidelity\+FX Super Resolution 1.\+0 (FSR) technique to perform upscaling.~\newline
Unlike the other Upscaling Filter options, this filter remains active even at a Render Scale value of 1.\+0. This filter can still improve image quality even when no scaling is occurring. This also makes the transition between scale values 0.\+99 and 1.\+0 less noticeable in cases where dynamic resolution scaling is active.~\newline
{\bfseries{Note}}\+: This filter is only supported on devices that support \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} shader model 4.\+5 or higher. On devices that do not support \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} shader model 4.\+5, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} uses the {\bfseries{Automatic}} option instead.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{Override FSR Sharpness}}   &\doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} shows this check box when you select the FSR filter. Selecting this check box lets you specify the intensity of the FSR sharpening pass.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;{\bfseries{FSR Sharpness}}   &Specify the intensity of the FSR sharpening pass. A value of 0.\+0 provides no sharpening, a value of 1.\+0 provides maximum sharpness. This option has no effect when FSR is not the active upscaling filter.    \\\cline{1-2}

You can select this by assigning it as a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GlobalIllumination.html}{\texttt{ Sun Source}} in the Lighting Inspector. If you don’t assign a sun source, the URP treats the brightest directional light in the Scene as the main light. You can choose between \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightPerformance.html}{\texttt{ Pixel Lighting}} and {\itshape None}.

{\bfseries{Soft Shadows}}   &Select this check box to enable extra processing of the shadow maps to give them a smoother look.~\newline
{\bfseries{Performance impact}}\+: high.~\newline
When this option is disabled, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} samples the shadow map once with the default hardware filtering.    \\\cline{1-2}
\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;\&\#160;Quality   &Select the quality level of soft shadow processing.~\newline
Available options\+:~\newline
{\bfseries{Low}}\+: good balance of quality and performance for mobile platforms. Filtering method\+: 4 PCF taps.~\newline
{\bfseries{Medium}}\+: good balance of quality and performance for desktop platforms. Filtering method\+: 5x5 tent filter. This is the default value.~\newline
{\bfseries{High}}\+: best quality, higher performance impact. Filtering method\+: 7x7 tent filter.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Conservative Enclosing Sphere}}   &Enable this option to improve shadow frustum culling and prevent \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} from excessively culling shadows in the corners of the shadow cascades.~\newline
Disable this option only for compatibility purposes of existing projects created in previous \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} versions.~\newline
If you enable this option in an existing project, you might need to adjust the shadows cascade distances because the shadow culling enclosing spheres change their size and position.~\newline
{\bfseries{Performance impact}}\+: enabling this option is likely to improve performance, because the option minimizes the overlap of shadow cascades, which reduces the number of redundant static shadow casters.   \\\cline{1-2}

{\bfseries{Post Processing}}   &This check box turns post-\/processing on (check box selected) or off (check box cleared) for the current URP asset.~\newline
If you clear this check box, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} excludes post-\/processing shaders and textures from the build, unless one of the following conditions is true\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Other assets in the build refer to the assets related to post-\/processing.
\item A different URP asset has the Post Processing property enabled.
\end{DoxyItemize}\\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Post Process Data}}   &The asset containing references to shaders and Textures that the Renderer uses for post-\/processing.~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} Changes to this property are necessary only for advanced customization use cases.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Grading Mode}}   &Select the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessing-ColorGrading.html}{\texttt{ color grading}} mode to use for the Project.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{High Dynamic Range}}\+: This mode works best for high precision grading similar to movie production workflows. \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} applies color grading before tonemapping.
\item {\bfseries{Low Dynamic Range}}\+: This mode follows a more classic workflow. \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} applies a limited range of color grading after tonemapping.
\end{DoxyItemize}\\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{LUT Size}}   &Set the size of the internal and external \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PostProcessing-ColorGrading.html}{\texttt{ look-\/up textures (LUTs)}} that the Universal Render Pipeline uses for color grading. Higher sizes provide more precision, but have a potential cost of performance and memory use. You cannot mix and match LUT sizes, so decide on a size before you start the color grading process.~\newline
The default value, {\bfseries{32}}, provides a good balance of speed and quality.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Fast s\+RGB/\+Linear Conversions}}   &Select this option to use faster, but less accurate approximation functions when converting between the s\+RGB and Linear color spaces.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Volume Update Mode}}   &Select how \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} updates Volumes\+: every frame or when triggered via scripting. In the Editor, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} updates Volumes every frame when not in the Play mode.   \\\cline{1-2}
