\item Added the Internal Inspector which allows the user to view data contained in selected nodes and properties in a new floating graph sub-\/window. Also added support for custom property drawers to let you visualize any data type you like and expose it to the inspector.
\item Added samples for Procedural Patterns to the package.
\item You can now use the right-\/click context menu to delete Sticky Notes.
\item You can now save your graph as a new Asset.
\item Added support for vertex skinning when you use the DOTS animation package.

\item If \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} Editor Analytics are enabled, Shader Graph collects anonymous data about which nodes you use in your graphs. This helps the Shader Graph team focus our efforts on the most common graph scenarios, and better understand the needs of our customers. We don\textquotesingle{}t track edge data and cannot recreate your graphs in any form.
\item The Create Node Menu now has a tree view and support for fuzzy field searching.
\item When a Shader Graph or Sub Graph Asset associated with a open window has been deleted, \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} now displays a dialog that asks whether you would like to save the graph as a new Asset or close the window.
\item Added a drop-\/down menu to the PBR Master Node that lets you select the final coordinate space of normals delivered from the fragment function.
\item Added support for users to drag and drop Blackboard Properties from one graph to another.
\item Breaking out Graph\+Data validation into clearer steps.
\item Added Alpha\+To\+Mask render state.
\item Added a field to the Master Nodes that overrides the generated shader\textquotesingle{}s Shader\+GUI, which determines how a Material that uses a Shader Graph looks.
\item Added Redirect Nodes. You can now double-\/click an edge to add a control point that allows you to route edges around other nodes and connect multiple output edges.
\item Added {\ttfamily Compute Deformation} Node to read deformed vertex data from Dots Deformations.
\item Added new graph nodes that allow sampling Virtual Textures
\item Shader Graph now uses a new file format that is much friendlier towards version control systems and humans. Existing Shader Graphs and will use the new format next time they are saved.
\item Added \textquotesingle{}Allow Material Override\textquotesingle{} option to the built-\/in target for shader graph.

\item Updated the functions in the {\ttfamily Normal From Height} node to avoid NaN outputs.
\item Changed the Voronoi Node algorithm to increase the useful range of the input values and to always use float values internally to avoid clipping.
\item Changed the {\ttfamily Reference Suffix} of Keyword Enum entries so that you cannot edit them, which ensures that material keywords compile properly.
\item Updated the dependent version of {\ttfamily Searcher} to 4.\+2.\+0.
\item Added support for {\ttfamily Linear Blend Skinning} Node to Universal Render Pipeline.
\item Moved all code to be under \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} specific namespaces.
\item Changed Shader\+Graph\+Importer and Shader\+Subgraph\+Importer so that graphs are imported before Models.
\item Remove VFXTarget if Visual\+Effect Graph package isn\textquotesingle{}t included.
\item VFXTarget doesn\textquotesingle{}t overwrite the shader export anymore, VFXTarget can be active with another target.

Shaders built with Shader Graph work with both the Lightweight and HD render pipelines. -\/ You can now modify vertex position via the Position slot on the PBR and Unlit Master nodes. By default, the input to this node is object space position. Custom inputs to this slot should specify the absolute local position of a given vertex. Certain nodes (such as Procedural Shapes) are not viable in the vertex shader. Such nodes are incompatible with this slot. -\/ You can now edit the Reference name for a property. To do so, select the property and type a new name next to Reference. If you want to reset to the default name, right-\/click Reference, and select Reset reference. -\/ In the expanded property window, you can now toggle whether the property is exposed. -\/ You can now change the path of Shader Graphs and Sub Graphs. When you change the path of a Shader Graph, this modifies the location it has in the shader selection list. When you change the path of Sub Graph, it will have a different location in the node creation menu. -\/ Added $<$tt$>$\+Is Front Face$<$/tt$>$ node. With this node, you can change graph output depending on the face sign of a given fragment. If the current fragment is part of a front face, the node returns true. For a back face, the node returns false. Note\+: This functionality requires that you have enabled $<$strong$>$two sided$<$/strong$>$ on the Master node. -\/ Gradient functionality is now available via two new nodes\+: Sample Gradient and Gradient Asset. The Sample Gradient node samples a gradient given a Time parameter. You can define this gradient on the Gradient slot control view. The Gradient Asset node defines a gradient that can be sampled by multiple Sample Gradient nodes using different Time parameters. -\/ Math nodes now have a Waves category. The category has four different nodes\+: Triangle wave, Sawtooth wave, Square wave, and Noise Sine wave. The Triangle, Sawtooth, and Square wave nodes output a waveform with a range of -\/1 to 1 over a period of 1. The Noise Sine wave outputs a standard Sine wave with a range of -\/1 to 1 over a period of 2 \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} pi. For variance, random noise is added to the amplitude of the Sine wave, within a determined range. -\/ Added $<$tt$>$\+Sphere Mask$<$/tt$>$ node for which you can indicate the starting coordinate and center point. The sphere mask uses these with the $<$strong$>$\+Radius$<$/strong$>$ and $<$strong$>$\+Hardness$<$/strong$>$ parameters. Sphere mask functionality works in both 2\+D and 3\+D spaces, and is based on the vector coordinates in the $<$strong$>$\+Coords and Center$<$/strong$>$ input. -\/ Added support for Texture 3\+D and Texture 2\+D Array via two new property types and four new nodes. -\/ A new node $<$tt$>$\+Texture 2\+D LOD$<$/tt$>$ has been added for LOD functionality on a Texture 2\+D Sample. Sample Texture 2\+D LOD uses the exact same input and output slots as Sample Texture 2\+D, but also includes an input for level of detail adjustments via a Vector1 slot. -\/ Added $<$tt$>$\+Texel Size$<$/tt$>$ node, which allows you to get the special texture properties of a Texture 2\+D Asset via the $<$tt$>$\{texturename\}\+\_\+\+Texel\+Size$<$/tt$>$ variable. Based on input from the Texture 2\+D Asset, the node outputs the width and height of the texel size in Vector1 format. -\/ Added $<$tt$>$\+Rotate About Axis$<$/tt$>$ node. This allows you to rotate a 3\+D vector space around an axis. For the rotation, you can specify an amount of degrees or a radian value. -\/ Unpacking normal maps in object space. -\/ Unpacking derivative maps option on sample texture nodes. -\/ Added Uint type for instancing support. -\/ Added HDR option for color material slots. -\/ Added definitions used by new HD Lit Master node. -\/ Added a popup control for a string list. -\/ Added conversion type (position/direction) to Transform\+Node. -\/ In your preview for nodes that are not master nodes, pixels now display as pink if they are not finite.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md2889 Changed -\/ The settings for master nodes now live in a small window that you can toggle on and off. Here, you can change various rendering settings for your shader. -\/ There are two Normal Derive Nodes\+: $<$tt$>$\+Normal From Height$<$/tt$>$ and $<$tt$>$\+Normal Reconstruct Z$<$/tt$>$.   $<$tt$>$\+Normal From Height$<$/tt$>$ uses Vector1 input to derive a normal map.   $<$tt$>$\+Normal Reconstruct Z$<$/tt$>$ uses the X and Y components in Vector2 input to derive the proper Z value for a normal map. -\/ The Texture type default input now accepts render textures. -\/ HD PBR subshader no longer duplicates surface description code into vertex shader. -\/ If the current render pipeline is not compatible, master nodes now display an error badge. -\/ The preview shader now only considers the current render pipeline. Because of this there is less code to compile, so the preview shader compiles faster. -\/ When you rename a shader graph or sub shader graph locally on your disk, the title of the Shader Graph window, black board, and preview also updates. -\/ Removed legacy matrices from Transfomation Matrix node. -\/ Texture 2\+D Array and Texture 3\+D nodes can no longer be used in the vertex shader. -\/ $<$tt$>$\+Normal Create$<$/tt$>$ node has been renamed to $<$tt$>$\+Normal From Texture$<$/tt$>$. -\/ When you close the Shader Graph after you have modified a file, the prompt about saving your changes now shows the file name as well. -\/ $<$tt$>$\+Blend$<$/tt$>$ node now supports Overwrite mode. -\/ $<$tt$>$\+Simple Noise$<$/tt$>$ node no longer has a loop. -\/ The $<$tt$>$\+Polygon$<$/tt$>$ node now calculates radius based on apothem. -\/ $<$tt$>$\+Normal Strength$<$/tt$>$ node now calculates Z value more accurately. -\/ You can now connect Sub Graphs to vertex shader slots. If a node in the Sub Graph specifies a shader stage, that specific Sub Graph node is locked to that stage. When an instance of a Sub Graph node is connected to a slot that specifies a shader stage, all slots on that instance are locked to the stage. -\/ Separated material options and tags. -\/ Master node settings are now recreated when a topological modification occurs.  @subsection autotoc\+\_\+md2890 Fixed -\/ Vector 1 nodes now evaluate correctly.
