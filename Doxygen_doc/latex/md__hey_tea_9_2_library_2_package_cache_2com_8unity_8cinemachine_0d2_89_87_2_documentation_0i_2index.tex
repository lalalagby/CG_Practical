\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} is a suite of modules for operating the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} camera. \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} solves the complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots. It is designed to significantly reduce the number of time-\/consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.

The procedural nature of these modules makes \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} bug-\/resistant. When you make adjustments—for example, change an animation, vehicle speed, terrain, or other Game\+Objects in your Scene—\+Cinemachine dynamically adjusts its behavior to make the best shot. There is no need, for example, to re-\/write camera scripts just because a character turns left instead of right.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} works in real time across all genres including FPS, third person, 2D, side-\/scroller, top down, and RTS. It supports as many shots in your Scene as you need. Its modular system lets you compose sophisticated behaviors.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} works well with other \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} tools, acting as a powerful complement to \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}, animation, and post-\/processing assets. Create your own \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_414e015286be387e4fe85aa25dd01df7}{extensions}{0} or integrate it with your custom camera scripts.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2index_autotoc_md746}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installing Cinemachine}{Installing Cinemachine}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2index_autotoc_md746}
\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} is a free package, available for any project. You install \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} like \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.package-manager-ui@latest/index.html}{\texttt{ any other package}}.

After you install \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine}, a new {\itshape \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine}} folder appears in the Gizmos folder of your Project window, and a new {\bfseries{Game\+Object \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine}}} menu is available. You can also access this menu when you right click inside the Hierarchy view.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} has no external dependencies. Just install it and start using it. If you are also using the Post Processing Stack (version 2), then adapter modules are provided -\/ protected by {\ttfamily ifdef} directives which auto-\/define if the presence of the Post Processing Stack is detected. ~\newline


There are similar {\ttfamily ifdef}-\/protected behaviours for other packages, such as HDRP Volumes, \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}, and Pixel-\/\+Perfect.
