\item Separated Premultiplied blend mode and Preserve Specular Lighting feature from each other. Premultiplied blend mode is now true straight premultiply mode. Preserve Specular Lighting, which applies alpha differently for diffuse and specular parts of lighting, is now a separate option for Alpha and Additive blend modes. The results of previous Premultiplied blend implementation can be achieved by using Alpha blend mode with Preserve Specular Lighting toggled on.
\item Multiply blend now keeps Dst\+Alpha as it\textquotesingle{}s RGB only.
\item Particle Alpha\+Modulate() renamed to Alpha\+Modulate\+And\+Premultiply() as it does both. Moved separate Alpha\+Modulate() and Alpha\+Premultiply() to URP shader library. Fix double alpha multiply for Particle\+Lit.
\item Improved blending modes trigger a material update which tries to keep the existing look intact. This is not always possible and manual blend mode changes might be required.

\item Moved fog evaluation from vertex shader to pixel shader. This improves rendering of fog for big triangles and fog quality. This can change the look of the fog slightly.
\item UNITY\+\_\+\+Z\+\_\+0\+\_\+\+FAR\+\_\+\+FROM\+\_\+\+CLIPSPACE now remaps to \mbox{[}0, far\mbox{]} range on all platforms consistently. Previously Open\+GL platforms did not remap, discarding small amount of range \mbox{[}-\/near, 0\mbox{]}.
\item Moved all 2D APIs out of experimental namespace.
\item Clear\+Flag.\+Depth does not implicitely clear stencil anymore. Clear\+Flag.\+Stencil added.

\item Removing unused temporary depth buffers for Depth of Field and Panini Projection.
\item Optimized the Bokeh Depth of Field shader on mobile by using half precision floats.
\item Changed Universal\+Render\+Pipeline\+Camera\+Editor to URPCamera\+Editor
\item Made 2D shadow casting more efficient
\item Reduced the size of the fragment input struct of the Terrain\+Lit\+Passes and Lit\+GBuffer\+Pass, Simple\+Lit\+Forward\+Pass and Simple\+Lit\+GBuffer\+Pass lighting shaders.
\item Bokeh Depth of Field performance improvement\+: moved some calculations from GPU to CPU.
\item Advanced Options \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Priority has been renamed to Sorting Priority
\item Opacity as Density blending feature for Terrain Lit Shader is now disabled when the Terrain has more than four Terrain Layers. This is now similar to the Height-\/blend feature for the Terrain Lit Shader.

\item SSAO Texture is now R8 instead of ARGB32 if supported by the platform.
\item Enabled subsurface scattering with GI on handwritten Universal ST8 shader.
\item Material upgrader now also upgrades Animation\+Clips in the project that have curves bound to renamed material properties.
\item 2D Lights now inherit from Light2\+DBase.
\item The behavior of setting a camera\textquotesingle{}s Background Type to "{}\+Dont Care"{} has changed on mobile. Previously, "{}\+Dont Care"{} would behave identically to "{}\+Solid Color"{} on mobile. Now, "{}\+Dont Care"{} corresponds to the render target being filled with arbitrary data at the beginning of the frame, which may be faster in some situations. Note that there are no guarantees for the exact content of the render target, so projects should use "{}\+Dont care"{} only if they are guaranteed to render to, or otherwise write every pixel every frame.
\item Stripping shader variants per renderer features instead of combined renderer features.
\item When MSAA is enabled and a depth texture is required, the opaque pass depth will be copied instead of scheduling a depth prepass.
\item URP Asset Inspector -\/ Advanced settings have been reordered under {\ttfamily Show Additional Properties} on each section.
\item Changed the default name when a new urp asset is created.
\item URP Asset Inspector -\/ {\ttfamily General} section has been renamed to {\ttfamily Rendering}.
\item Refactored some of the array resizing code around decal projector rendering to use new APIs in render core
\item Universal\+Renderer\+Data and Forward\+Renderer\+Data GUIDs have been reversed so that users coming from 2019LTS, 2020LTS and 2021.\+1 have a smooth upgrade path, you may encounter issues coming from 2021.\+2 Alpha/\+Beta versions and are recommended to start with a fresh library if initial upgrade fails.

\item Optimized 2D Renderer performance on mobile GPUs by reducing the number of render target switches.
\item Optimized 2D Renderer performance by rendering the normal buffer at the same lower resolution as the light buffers.
\item Improved Light2D UI/\+UX
\item Improved 2D Menu layout
\item Deprecated Light2D Parametric Light
\item Deprecated Light2D point light cookie
\item Renamed Light2D point light to spot light
\item 2D Renderer\+: The per Blend Style render texture scale setting was replaced by a global scale setting for all Blend Styles.
\item Optimized 2D Renderer performance by using a tiny light texture for layer/blend style pairs for which no light is rendered.
\item Reorgnized the settings in 2D Renderer Data Inspector.
\item Fall\+Off Lookup Texture is now part of 2D Render\+Data.
\item Creating a Shadow Caster 2D will use try and use sprite and physics bounds as the default shape
\item Deleting all points in a Shadow Caster will cause the shape to use the bounds.
\item Improved Geometry for Smooth Falloff of 2D Shape Lights.
\item Updated the tooltips for Light 2D Inspector.
\item Removed the Custom blend Mode option from the Blend Styles.

\item Bloom in Gamma color-\/space now more closely matches Linear color-\/space, this will mean project using Bloom and Gamma color-\/space may need to adjust Bloom Intensity to match previous look.
\item Autodesk Interactive Shader Graph files and folders containing them were renamed. The new file paths do not have spaces.
\item Moved {\ttfamily Final\+Post\+Process\+Pass} to {\ttfamily After\+Rendering\+Post\+Processing} event from {\ttfamily After\+Rendering}. This allows user pass to execute before and after {\ttfamily Final\+Post\+Process\+Pass} and {\ttfamily Capture\+Pass} to capture everything.
\item Changed shader keywords of main light shadow from toggling to enumerating.
\item Always use "{}\+High"{} quality normals, which normalizes the normal in pixel shader. "{}\+Low"{} quality normals looked too much like a bug.
\item Re-\/enabled implicit MSAA resolve to backbuffer on Metal Mac\+OS.
\item Optimized 2D performance by rendering straight to the backbuffer if possible
\item Changed Post Process Data to bool. When it is no enabled all post processing is stripped from build, when it is enabled you can still override resources there.

\item You can now implement a custom renderer for LWRP. To do so, implement an {\ttfamily IRenderer\+Data} that contains all resources used in rendering. Then create an {\ttfamily IRenderer\+Setup} that creates and queues {\ttfamily Scriptable\+Render\+Pass}. Change the renderer type either in the Pipeline Asset or in the Camera Inspector.
\item LWRP now uses the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} recorder extension. You can use this to capture the output of Cameras.
\item You can now inject a custom render pass before LWRP renders opaque objects. To do so, implement an {\ttfamily IBefore\+Render} interface.
\item Distortion support in all Particle Shaders.
\item An upgrade system for LWRP Materials with {\ttfamily Material\+Postprocessor}.
\item An upgrade path for Unlit shaders
\item Tooltips for Shaders.
\item SRP Batcher support for Particle Shaders.
\item Docs for these Shaders\+: Baked Lit, Particles Lit, Particles Simple Lit, and Particles Unlit.
\item LWRP now supports dynamic resolution scaling. The target platform must also support it.
\item LWRP now includes version defines for both C\# and Shaders in the format of {\ttfamily LWRP\+\_\+\+X\+\_\+\+Y\+\_\+\+Z\+\_\+\+OR\+\_\+\+NEWER}. For example, {\ttfamily LWRP\+\_\+5\+\_\+3\+\_\+0\+\_\+\+OR\+\_\+\+NEWER} defines version 5.\+3.\+0.
\item The Terrain Lit Shader now samples Spherical Harmonics if you haven\textquotesingle{}t baked any lightmaps for terrain.
\item Added a {\bfseries{Priority}} option, which you can use to tweak the rendering order. This is similar to render queue in the built-\/in render pipeline. These Shaders now have this option\+: Lit, Simple Lit, Baked Lit, Unlit, and all three Particle Shaders.
\item Added support for overriding terrain detail rendering shaders, via the render pipeline editor resources asset.

\item LWRP now uses RGB111110 as the HDR format on mobile devices, when this format is supported.
\item Removed {\ttfamily IAfter\+Depth\+Pre\+Pass} interface.
\item We’ve redesigned the Shader GUI. For example, all property names in Shaders are now inline across the board
\item The Simple Lit Shader now has Smoothness, which can be stored in the alpha of specular or albedo maps.
\item The Simple Lit and Particles Simple Lit Shaders now take shininess from the length (brightness) of the specular map.
\item The {\bfseries{Double sided}} property is now {\bfseries{Render Face}}. This means you can also do front face culling.
\item Changed the docs for Lit Shader, Simple Lit Shader and Unlit Shader according to Shader GUI changes.
\item When you create a new LWRP Asset, it will now be initialized with settings that favor performance on mobile platforms.
\item Updated the FAQ section and the Built-\/in/\+LWRP feature comparison table.

\item Directional Lights are always considered a main light in shader. They have a fast shading path with no branching and no indexing.
\item Get\+Main\+Light() is provided in shader to initialize Light struct with main light shading data.
\item Directional lights have a dedicated shadowmap for performance reasons. Shadow coord always comes from interpolator.
\item Main\+Ligth\+Realtime\+Shadow\+Attenuation(float4 shadow\+Coord) is provided to compute main light realtime shadows.
\item Spot and Point lights are always shaded in the light loop. Branching on uniform and indexing happens when shading them.
\item Get\+Light(half index, float3 position\+WS) is provided in shader to initialize Light struct for spot and point lights.
\item Spot light shadows are baked into a single shadow atlas.
\item Shadow coord for spot lights is always computed on fragment.
\item Use Local\+Light\+Shadow\+Attenuation(int light\+Index, float3 position\+WS) to comppute realtime shadows for spot lights.
