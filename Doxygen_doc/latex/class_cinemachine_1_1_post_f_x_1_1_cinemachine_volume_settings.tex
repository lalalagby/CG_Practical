\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This behaviour is a liaison between \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} with the Post-\/\+Processing v3 module. 

As a component on the Virtual Camera, it holds a Post-\/\+Processing Profile asset that will be applied to the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} camera whenever the Virtual camera is live. It also has the optional functionality of animating the Focus Distance and Depth\+Of\+Field properties of the Camera State, and applying them to the current Post-\/\+Processing profile, provided that profile has a Depth\+Of\+Field effect that is enabled.
