 In the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), use this Shader for particles where performance is more important than photorealism. This Shader uses a simple approximation for lighting. Because this Shader \href{shading-model.md\#simple-shading}{\texttt{ does not calculate for physical correctness and energy conservation}}, it renders quickly.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do1a4380a85dc7c7008128dcabd90d3de1_autotoc_md2257}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Using the Particles Simple Lit Shader in the Editor}{Using the Particles Simple Lit Shader in the Editor}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8render-pipelines_8universal_0d14_80_88_2_do1a4380a85dc7c7008128dcabd90d3de1_autotoc_md2257}

{\bfseries{Surface Type}}   &Use this drop-\/down to apply an {\bfseries{Opaque}} or {\bfseries{Transparent}} surface type to the Material. This determines which render pass URP renders the material in. {\bfseries{Opaque}} surface types are always fully visible, regardless of what’s behind them. URP renders opaque Materials first. {\bfseries{Transparent}} surface types are affected by their background, and they can vary according to which type of transparent surface type you choose. URP renders transparent Materials in a separate pass after opaque objects. If you select {\bfseries{Transparent}}, the {\bfseries{Blending Mode}} drop-\/down appears.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Blending Mode}}   &Use this drop-\/down to determine how URP calculates the color of each pixel of the transparent Material by blending the Material with the background pixels.~\newline
{\bfseries{Alpha}} uses the Material’s alpha value to change how transparent an object is. 0 is fully transparent. 1 appears fully opaque, but the Material is still rendered during the Transparent render pass. This is useful for visuals that you want to be fully visible but to also fade over time, like clouds.~\newline
{\bfseries{Premultiply}} applies a similar effect to the Material as {\bfseries{Alpha}}, but preserves reflections and highlights, even when your surface is transparent. This means that only the reflected light is visible. For example, imagine transparent glass.~\newline
{\bfseries{Additive}} adds an extra layer to the Material, on top of another surface. This is good for holograms. ~\newline
{\bfseries{Multiply}} multiplies the color of the Material with the color behind the surface. This creates a darker effect, like when you look through colored glass.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Render Face}}   &Use this drop-\/down to determine which sides of your geometry to render.~\newline
{\bfseries{Front Face}} renders the front face of your geometry and \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-CullAndDepth.html}{\texttt{ culls}} the back face. This is the default setting. ~\newline
{\bfseries{Back Face}} renders the front face of your geometry and culls the front face. ~\newline
{\bfseries{Both}} makes URP render both faces of the geometry. This is good for small, flat objects, like leaves, where you might want both sides visible.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Alpha Clipping}}   &Makes your Material act like a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterRenderingMode.html}{\texttt{ Cutout}} Shader. Use this to create a transparent effect with hard edges between the opaque and transparent areas. For example, to create blades of grass. To achieve this effect, URP does not render alpha values below the specified {\bfseries{Threshold}}, which appears when you enable {\bfseries{Alpha Clipping}}. You can set the {\bfseries{Threshold}} by moving the slider, which accepts values from 0 to 1. All values above your threshold are fully opaque, and all values below your threshold are invisible. For example, a threshold of 0.\+1 means that URP doesn\textquotesingle{}t render alpha values below 0.\+1. The default value is 0.\+5.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Color Mode}}   &Use this drop-\/down to determine how the particle color and the Material color blend together.~\newline
 {\bfseries{Multiply}} produces a darker final color by multiplying the two colors.~\newline
{\bfseries{Additive}} produces a brighter final colour by adding the two colours together.{\bfseries{Subtractive}} subtracts the particle color from the base color of the Material. This creates an overall dark effect in the pixel itself, with less brightness.~\newline
{\bfseries{Overlay}} blends the particle color over the base color of the Material. This creates a brighter color at values over 0.\+5 and darker colors at values under 0.\+5.~\newline
{\bfseries{Color}} uses the particle color to colorize the Material color, while keeping the value and saturation of the base color of the Material. This is good for adding splashes of color to monochrome Scenes.~\newline
{\bfseries{Difference}} returns the difference between both color values. This is good for blending Particle and Material colors that are similar to each other.   \\\cline{1-2}

The {\bfseries{Surface Inputs}} describe the surface itself. For example, you can use these properties to make your surface look wet, dry, rough, or smooth.

{\bfseries{Base Map}}   &Adds color to the surface. To assign a Texture to the {\bfseries{Base Map}} setting, click the object picker next to it. This opens the Asset Browser, where you can select from the Textures in your Project. Alternatively, you can use the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditingValueProperties.html}{\texttt{ color picker}}. The color next to the setting shows the tint on top of your assigned Texture. To assign another tint, you can click this color swatch. If you select {\bfseries{Transparent}} or {\bfseries{Alpha Clipping}} under {\bfseries{Surface Options}}, your Material uses the Texture’s alpha channel or color. The Base Map is also known as a diffuse map.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Specular Map}}   &Controls the color of your specular highlights from direct lighting, for example \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html}{\texttt{ Directional, Point, and Spot lights}}. To assign a Texture to the {\bfseries{Specular Map}} setting, click the object picker next to it. This opens the Asset Browser, where you can select from the Textures in your Project. Alternatively, you can use the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditingValueProperties.html}{\texttt{ color picker}}. ~\newline
In\+\_\+\+\_\+ Source\+\_\+\+\_\+, you can select a Texture in your Project to act as a source for the smoothness. By default, the source is the alpha channel for this Texture. ~\newline
You can use the {\bfseries{Smoothness}} slider to control the spread of highlights on the surface. 0 gives a wide, rough highlight. 1 gives a small, sharp highlight like glass. Values in between 0 and 1 produce semi-\/glossy looks. For example, 0.\+5 produces a plastic-\/like glossiness.~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} If this setting appears greyed out, check if {\bfseries{Specular Highlights}} are enabled under the {\bfseries{Advanced}} settings.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Normal Map}}   &Adds a normal map to the surface. With a \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialParameterNormalMap.html}{\texttt{ normal map}}, you can add surface details like bumps, scratches and grooves. To add the map, click the object picker next to it. The normal map picks up ambient lighting in the environment.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Emission}}   &Makes the surface look like it emits lights. When enabled, the {\bfseries{Emission Map}} and {\bfseries{Emission Color}} settings appear.~\newline
To assign an {\bfseries{Emission Map}}, click the object picture next to it. This opens the Asset Browser, where you can select from the textures in your Project.~\newline
For {\bfseries{Emission Color}}, you can use the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditingValueProperties.html}{\texttt{ color picker}} to assign a tint on top of the color. This can be more than 100\% white, which is useful for effects like lava, that shines brighter than white while still being another color.~\newline
If you have not assigned an {\bfseries{Emission Map}}, the {\bfseries{Emission}} setting only uses the tint you’ve assigned in {\bfseries{Emission Color}}.~\newline
If you do not enable {\bfseries{Emission}}, URP sets the emission to black and does not calculate emission.   \\\cline{1-2}

{\bfseries{Flip-\/\+Book Blending}}   &Tick this box to blend flip-\/book frames together. This is useful in texture sheet animations with limited frames, because it makes animations smoother. If you have performance issues, try turning this off.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Specular Highlights}}   &When enabled, your particles have specular highlights from direct lighting, for example \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html}{\texttt{ Directional, Point, and Spot lights}}. This means that each particle reflects the shine from these light sources. When disabled, these highlight calculations are not part of the Shader, which can make the Shader render faster. By default, this feature is enabled.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Vertex Streams}}   &This list shows the vertex streams that this Material requires in order to work properly. If the vertex streams aren’t correctly assigned, the {\bfseries{Fix Now}} button appears. Click this button to apply the correct setup of vertex streams to the Particle \doxylink{namespace_system}{System} that this Material is assigned to.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Sorting Priority}}   &Use this slider to determine the chronological rendering order for a Material. URP renders Materials with lower values first. You can use this to reduce overdraw on devices by making the pipeline render Materials in front of other Materials first, so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to render overlapping areas twice. This works similarly to the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Material-renderQueue.html}{\texttt{ render queue}} in the built-\/in \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} render pipeline.   \\\cline{1-2}

{\bfseries{Soft Particles}}   &Tick this box to make particles fade out when they get close to intersecting with the surface of other geometry written into the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RenderTexture.html}{\texttt{ depth buffer}}.~\newline
When you enable this feature, the {\bfseries{Surface Fade}} settings appear\+:~\newline
{\bfseries{Near}} sets the distance from the other surface where the particle is completely transparent. This is where the particle appears to fade out completely.~\newline
{\bfseries{Far}} sets the distance from the other surface where the particle is completely opaque. The particle appears solid here.~\newline
Distances are measured in world units. Only usable for transparent surface types.~\newline
~\newline
{\bfseries{Note\+:}} This setting uses the {\ttfamily Camera\+Depth\+Texture} that is created by URP.

{\bfseries{Distortion}}   &Creates a distortion effect by making particles perform refraction with the objects drawn before them. This is useful for creating a heat wave effect or for warping objects behind the particles. ~\newline
When you enable this feature, these settings appear\+:~\newline
{\bfseries{Strength}} controls how much the Particle distorts the background. Negative values have the opposite effect of positive values. So if something was offset to the right with a positive value, the equal negative value offsets it to the left.~\newline
{\bfseries{Blend}} controls how visible the distortion is. At 0, there is no visible distortion. At 1, only the distortion effect is visible.~\newline
