 The {\bfseries{\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Clear\+Shot Camera}} component chooses among its children Virtual Cameras for the best quality shot of the target. Use Clear Shot to set up complex multi-\/camera coverage of a Scene to guarantee a clear view of the target.

This can be a very powerful tool. Virtual Camera children with \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_collider}{Cinemachine Collider}{0} extensions analyze the Scene for target obstructions, optimal target distance, and so on. Clear Shot uses this information to choose the best child to activate.

{\bfseries{Tip\+:}} To use a single \doxysectlink{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_collider}{Cinemachine Collider}{0} for all Virtual Camera children, add a \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider extension to the Clear\+Shot Game\+Object instead of each of its Virtual Camera children. This \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Collider extension applies to all of the children, as if each of them had that Collider as its own extension.

If multiple child cameras have the same shot quality, the Clear Shot camera chooses the one with the highest priority.

You can also define custom blends between the Clear\+Shot children.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_clear_shot_autotoc_md663}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_clear_shot_autotoc_md663}

{\bfseries{Game Window Guides}}   &Enables the displays of overlays in the Game window. Adjust the color and opacity in \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} Preferences. This is a global setting, shared by all virtial cameras.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Save During Play}}   &When enabled, virtual camera setting changes made during Play mode are propagated back to the scene when Play mode is exited. This is a global setting, shared by all objects that support Save During Play.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Look At}}   &The default target Game\+Object that the children Virtual Camera move with. The Clear Shot camera uses this target when the child does not specify this target. May be empty if all of the children define targets of their own.    \\\cline{1-2}
{\bfseries{Follow}}   &The target Game\+Object to aim the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} camera at. The Clear Shot camera uses this target when the child does not specify this target. May be empty if all of the children define targets of their own.    \\\cline{1-2}
