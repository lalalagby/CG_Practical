 A {\bfseries{noise profile}} is an asset that defines a procedural curve for camera noise. The {\bfseries{Basic Multi Channel Perlin}} component applies a noise profile to the movement of the camera. \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} applies noise movement after computing the position of the camera. This way, camera noise does not affect the computation of camera movement in future updates.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} includes some predefined profile assets. Choose a predefined noise profile in the Noise component. Create your own noise profile asset by choosing {\bfseries{Create \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Noise\+Settings}} in the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html}{\texttt{ Project window}}.

The properties in the Inspector show graphs that give a visual representation of the noise profile. There are properties for the x, y, and z axes for position and rotation. Each axis may have more than one layer.



For realistic procedural noise, choose frequencies and amplitudes with care to ensure an interesting noise quality that is not obviously repetitive. The most convincing camera shakes use {\bfseries{Rotation}} noise because that’s where the camera is aiming. Handheld camera operators tend to shake more rotationally than they do positionally. After specifying {\bfseries{Rotation}} noise, add {\bfseries{Position}} noise.

Convincing noise profiles typically mix low, medium, and high frequencies together. When creating a new noise profile, start with these three layers of noise for each axis.

For amplitude, use larger values for wider lenses to shake the camera noticeably. For telephoto lenses, use smaller amplitude values because the narrower FOV amplifies the effect.

For frequency, a typical low range is 0.\+1-\/0.\+5 Hz, the mid range 0.\+8-\/1.\+5, and the high 3-\/4. The highest useful frequency depends on the frame rate of your game. A game typically runs at 30 or 60Hz. Noise frequencies higher than the frame rate of your game fall between the cracks of the Nyquist rate. In other words, they will not be directly tracked.

For example, if your game runs at 60 frames/second and you set a frequency to 100, you will get choppy camera noise. This is because your game can’t render something that moves faster than the frame rate.\hypertarget{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_noise_profiles_autotoc_md707}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Properties\+:}{Properties\+:}}\label{md__hey_tea_9_2_library_2_package_cache_2com_8unity_8cinemachine_0d2_89_87_2_documentation_0i_2_cinemachine_noise_profiles_autotoc_md707}
