 This Virtual Camera {\bfseries{Body}} algorithm is intended for use to implement a 3rd-\/person or 1st person camera. The algorithm places the camera on a mini-\/rig with 3 pivot points\+:

Pivot point 1 is the {\itshape origin}, which is the Follow target\textquotesingle{}s position. When the target rotates horizontally, the rig rotates with it around this point.

Pivot point 2 is the {\itshape shoulder}, and by default is offset to one side of Pivot Point 1, to create an over-\/the-\/shoulder follow position. To make a 1st-\/person camera, set this offset to 0, or to whatever will give an appropriate 1st-\/person effect given your Follow target\textquotesingle{}s position. Vertical rotations of the Follow target are transferred here, so the rig rotates horizontally about the origin, and vertically about the shoulder.

Pivot point 3 is the {\itshape hand}. This is by default offset from the shoulder, so that vertical rotations will keep the character nicely positioned on the screen. For 1st-\/person cameras, this can be set to 0.

Finally, the camera is positioned behind the hand, at a specifiable distance from it. The camera\textquotesingle{}s rotation will always be parallel to the Follow target\textquotesingle{}s rotation, but positioned behind the hand.

The camera\textquotesingle{}s position and rotation are controlled by moving and rotating the Follow target, not by independent camera controls.

The 3rd-\/person Follow module has a built-\/in collision resolution system, so that if the target moves close to an obstacle, the camera position will be adjusted so that it will never be inside an obstacle.
