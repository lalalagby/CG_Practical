\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} is a suite of modules for operating the \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} camera. \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} solves the complex mathematics and logic of tracking targets, composing, blending, and cutting between shots. It\textquotesingle{}s designed to significantly reduce the number of time-\/consuming manual manipulations and script revisions that take place during development.

The procedural nature of these modules makes \doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} bug-\/resistant. When you make adjustments—for example, change an animation, vehicle speed, terrain, or other Game\+Objects in your Scene—\+Cinemachine dynamically adjusts its behavior to make the best shot. There is no need, for example, to re-\/write camera scripts just because a character turns left instead of right.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} works in real time across all genres including FPS, third person, 2D, side-\/scroller, top down, and RTS. It supports as many shots in your Scene as you need. Its modular system lets you compose sophisticated behaviors.

\doxylink{namespace_cinemachine}{Cinemachine} works well with other \doxylink{namespace_unity}{Unity} tools, acting as a powerful complement to \doxylink{namespace_timeline}{Timeline}, animation, and post-\/processing assets.
